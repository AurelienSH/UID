say:12	be:14	0	 So I ended up having to order them, but she said there was no way to do a direct exchange.

say:14	see:18	1	 The waters of the islands are known for their clarity, it being said that you can see the bottom at 40 metres.

suggest:5	island:13	0	 Findings of Lapita pottery suggest that early-Polynesians were on these islands close to 3000 years ago.

ensure:34	have:37	1	 Growing Beavertail can be done at any time of year by scattering seeds in a shady bed or, for faster results, planting cuttings in a mix of soil and sand and ensuring that they have a bit of water and plenty of sun.

make sure:2	shade:10	1	 Make sure that the garden bed is in the shade.

be aware:2	take:9	1	 Be aware that growing Beavertail cactus from seeds takes much longer than growing one from a cutting.

make sure:2	be:4	0	 Make sure there are holes in the center of the base of each pot to allow for good drainage.

make sure:2	shelter:6	0	 Make sure the spot is sheltered from any cold winter winds.

be aware:3	have:8	0	 Just be aware, not all cats have enough energy, interest or training to hunt mice.

know:8	hunter:16	0	 Shelters and adoption agencies often do not know if a cat is a good mouse hunter, and generally do not test for this.

make sure:2	have:6	0	 Make sure the shelter box has no nails or safety hazards.

show:6	lead:16	1	 As an example, research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [1] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [2, 3] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers.

believe:11	take:19	1	 In other words, it is critical that economic agents believe that their property rights will not be taken away by other public or private actors [15].

note:11	feel:34	1	 Besides the enjambment types above, Spang (1983) noted that if a subject or direct object and their related verbs occur in two different lines of poetry, this can also feel unusual for a reader, even if the effect is less pronounced than in the environments identified by Quilis.

ensure:37	take:41	1	 For instance, those with an interest in deceiving the general public may set up parallel institutions that ostensibly guarantee expertise, taking advantage of the ways in which these parallel institutions mimic legitimate institutions to ensure that people are taken in.

think:31	speak:35	1	 Such an organization is surely permissible, but it has had the unfortunate (and likely intended) effect of muddying debates in the public forum by misleading people into thinking that the college speaks for the pediatric profession at large.

indicate:7	difficult:9	0	 The controversy surrounding Beall’s decision indicates how difficult it is to make such judgments — even for professionals.

note:18	publish:22	1	 Since conflicts of interest are a reason to discount expertise, it is incumbent on me to note that I have published in Frontiers journals on several occasions.

suggest:16	have:20	1	 With respect to the contributions of digital games to improvement of cognitive processes, researchers suggest that regular practice has a significant influence on improving the performance related to basic visual skills (Li, Polat, Scalzo, & Bavelier, 2010); on the ability to perceive objects simultaneously (Dye & Bavelier, 2010; Feng, Spence, & Pratt, 2007); and on the ability to do more than one task at the same time (Boot, Kramer, Simons, Fabiani, & Gratton, 2008).

suggest:15	word:57	1	 From a systematic comparison of 10 spoken languages from 5 continents we find evidence suggesting that a word like ‘Huh?’ – used as a ‘repair initiator’ when, for example, one has not clearly heard what someone just said [5], [6] – is a universal word.

show:9	great:30	1	 In support of the first claim, we show that the similarities in form and function of an interjection with the specific function of repair initiation are very much greater across languages than chance coincidence would admit.

show:9	meet:13	1	 In support of the second claim, we show that Huh? meets the criteria of a word in the sense of being a conventional lexical sign which must be learnt.

find:36	linguistic:41	1	 Thus, in contrast to what has been presumed for interjections in general [7], [8] and for huh? in particular [9], [10], we find that this item is linguistic in nature rather than being a mere grunt or non-lexical sound.

show:2	calibrate:8	1	 We show that the form is locally calibrated in ways that show it fitting within different language systems.

observe:2	fulfil:6	1	 We observe that this item fulfils a crucial need shared by all languages – the efficient signalling of problems of hearing and understanding – and we propose that its form is constrained by selective pressures in a conversational environment that is essentially the same in all languages.

show:3	possible:7	1	 These examples show that it is possible to identify the same conversational structure in unrelated languages.

find:8	appear:26	1	 By compiling data from published literature we found that in thirty-one languages around the world, the interjection for other-initiated repair appears to be strongly similar (Figure 1).

make sure:25	compare:28	0	 Such alternative (and probably derived) uses provide insight in possible paths of semantic change, but we exclude them here to make sure we are comparing like with like.

find:12	respond:15	1	 however, in the study by Hein and colleagues it was found that children responded more or less frequently based on factors such as stimuli type.

believe:14	produce:20	1	 It is possible that these two children understood the task and really did believe that the puppet did not produce any poor descriptions, and in this regard, are not yet adult-like in their SI interpretations.

say:6	say:14	1	 This is unlikely as they said that even the first training item was said well.

seem:22	necessity:28	1	 In fact, someone’s productivity, particularly at night, depends on the presence of a good lighting and it seems that it is a daily necessity.

check:7	correct:13	1	 It simulates the error of not checking that the coordinate system is correct.

give:20	influential:31	1	 The narrative review considers challenges in replication research and is largely informed by commentaries and metascience from psychology, given that the cognitive and social subdomains of psychology are highly influential in L2 research, and also from education, another key sister discipline.

mean:20	surface:32	1	 In addition, the widely used empirical models decouple the wind effect from SSS and SST effects, which means that the surface emission is due to a perfectly flat sea surface and the wind-roughened sea surface.

show:3	produce:14	1	 We have shown that the addition of an artificial tail during ontogeny can produce postural and locomotory changes in chickens, consistent with the posture and kinematics inferred for non-avian dinosaurs [5], [6], [11].

show:3	affect:16	1	 Our data show that for a given CFL mass, femoral retraction can be greatly affected by the location of the CoM and limb postures.

suggest:8	increase:12	1	 Experimental manipulations of femoral orientation in chickens suggest that torsional loads increase as the femur becomes more horizontal [7] supporting the idea that postural differences could be reflected in differences in limb cross-sectional geometry.

consider:6	fail:20	1	 Maybe this is not surprising considering that a recent study analyzing the relationship between posture and femur cross-sectional properties failed to find differences between birds and non-avian theropods [24], suggesting that simple morphological correlates of limb posture should be used with caution.

suggest:33	use:43	1	 Maybe this is not surprising considering that a recent study analyzing the relationship between posture and femur cross-sectional properties failed to find differences between birds and non-avian theropods [24], suggesting that simple morphological correlates of limb posture should be used with caution.

suggest:22	reduce:26	1	 Longer limbs are expected to experience larger bending and torsional moments, so the fact that experimental animals had longer femora suggests that limb verticalization reduces these moments by orienting the bone more parallel to the GRF line of action.

suggest:2	due:8	1	 We suggest that the different outcomes are due to the distinct rearing and exercising conditions used in each study, in addition to the different artificial tails used.

suggest:2	explain:9	1	 This suggests that their results could be partially explained as a response to the increased loading rather than to the displacement of the CoM.

show:37	recreate:48	1	 It has even been proposed that, due to functional convergence, mammals might be a better system to study bipedal dinosaur locomotion [7], [23], but the results reported here show that important aspects of non-avian theropod locomotion can be experimentally recreated in modern birds.

mean:6	have:10	1	 Nonetheless, this does not mean that tail reduction had no effect on CoM displacement, but that it was not the most important factor.

say:6	more:14	1	 It is no exaggeration to say that HBO’s Game of Thrones is more than just a television series or a successful brand:

forget:13	adaptation:21	1	 Given the volume of content this represents, it is easy to forget that the television series itself is an adaptation of a book series with a pre-existing fandom.

note:21	related:34	1	 To investigate this, Daniel experimented by puncturing the wall of a pipe with a small open ended straw and noted that the height to which the fluid rose up the straw was related to fluid's pressure in the pipe.

seem:31	have:36	1	 After his expulsion became official in January 1831, he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest, but this waned, as it seemed that his political activism had priority. [4] [7]

suggest:54	publish:59	1	 Around 4 July 1831, Poisson declared Galois' work "incomprehensible", declaring that "[Galois'] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor"; however, the rejection report ends on an encouraging note: "We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion." [16]

suggest:8	Mademoiselle:17	1	 Some archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was a Mademoiselle Stéphanie-Félicie Poterin du Motel, [18] the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life.

mention:19	find:23	1	 Galois' cousin, Gabriel Demante, when asked if he knew the cause of the duel, mentioned that Galois "found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fiancé, each of whom provoked the duel."

say:4	piece:30	0	 Mathematician Hermann Weyl said of this testament, "This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind."

know:8	fix:11	0	 when it came to the joinery she knew we could fix that later.

know:11	have:18	1	 She fell in love with him right away, not knowing that, at 31, he had a reputation as a womanizer.

realize:4	write:7	1	 Nor did she realize that he wrote popular literature which aimed to please the general public and in no way wished to be associated with serious literature.

find:4	enter:6	0	 Often I would find myself entering those crypts, deep dug in the earth, with their walls on either side lined with the bodies of the dead, where everything was so dark that almost it seemed as though the Psalmist's words were fulfilled, Let them go down quick into Hell. [14]

think:15	looking:19	0	 One video, released in 2010 and entitled "How To Trick People Into Thinking You're Good Looking" was viewed over 5.3 million times in its first week. [10] [11]

state:6	sick:11	0	 In the video, she stated, "I'm sick and tired of guys thinking that just because I showed up at a club or a dance or a bar, that I want to have their genitalia touching my backside"; [12] [13] the video had approximately 36.2 million views as of March 2018. [14]

think:16	want:35	1	 In the video, she stated, "I'm sick and tired of guys thinking that just because I showed up at a club or a dance or a bar, that I want to have their genitalia touching my backside"; [12] [13] the video had approximately 36.2 million views as of March 2018. [14]

say:9	wonderful:4	0	 "It was wonderful there", Moreau said.

give:28	identical:35	1	 This theory, along with other theories of correspondence in translating, are elaborated in his essay Principles of Correspondence, where Nida begins by asserting that given that "no two languages are identical, either in the meanings given to corresponding symbols or in the ways in which symbols are arranged in phrases and sentences, it stands to reason that there can be no absolute correspondence between languages.

seem:3	practice:5	0	 Although it seems Theodorus practiced complete submission to the new leader of the Koinonia, problems soon arose in several Pachomian monasteries that viewed Horsiesios as a weak leader.

say:12	go:17	0	 And then he turned to those who remained, and he said, will ye also go away?

say:7	have:15	0	 And so Erasmus is going to say, so obviously, in Scripture we have paradox.

indicate:11	have:14	1	 We have clear passages of Scripture, which seem to indicate that man has a free will, and that he can exercise that will, to follow, or not to follow.

indicate:15	free:22	1	 On the other hand, we have passages of Scripture, which seem to indicate, that the will is not free, and that the –, and that man i- th- is – man is predestined by a an omnipotent sovereign will of God.

believe:23	tell:29	1	 When Tyler was very young, his grandmother was his favorite person in the world because, unlike his parents, who believed that children should always be told the truth as adults understood it, she would fill in the gaps in his knowledge — Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, God.

assume:13	lack:28	1	 He made the common error of identifying maturity with worth, and assumed that the love he had for her as a young child must have been lacking in strength and depth.

see:7	grow:10	0	 In Tyler’s mind he could see her face grow taut, lose color, and then, for the only time he could remember, she began to cry.

know:5	place:12	1	 At that time he knew only vaguely that Hell was a place you did not want to go, like the dark basement or the even darker attic.

know:21	speed:26	0	 Though most hid it well, he was convinced they were all as nervous and scared as he was - knowing they could well be speeding only to their own deaths.

think:5	hundred:1	0	 Hundreds of millions? thought Chalmers.

see:33	have:37	1	 And as I ran along the shore, crushing sleeping flowers with heedless feet and maddened ever by the fear of unknown things and the lure of the dead faces, I saw that the garden had no end under that moon; for where by day the walls were, there stretched now only new vistas of trees and paths, flowers and shrubs, stone idols and pagodas, and bendings of the yellow-litten stream past grassy banks and under grotesque bridges of marble.

see:4	vanish:10	0	 And as I saw therein the lotos-faces vanish, I longed for nets that I might capture them and learn from them the secrets which the moon had brought upon the night.

know:2	come:12	1	 And knowing that to this sunken place all the dead had come, I trembled and did not wish again to speak with the lotos-faces.

see:4	descend:13	0	 Yet when I saw afar out in the sea a black condor descend from the sky to seek rest on a vast reef, I would fain have questioned him, and asked him of those whom I had known when they were alive.

see:14	gleam:15	0	 So I watched the tide go out under that sinking moon, and saw gleaming the spires, the towers, and the roofs of that dead, dripping city.

see:16	ebb:21	1	 Nor had my flesh trembled without cause, for when I raised my eyes I saw that the waters had ebbed very low, shewing much of the vast reef whose rim I had seen before.

see:4	crown:13	1	 And when I saw that the reef was but the black basalt crown of a shocking eikon whose monstrous forehead now shown in the dim moonlight and whose vile hooves must paw the hellish ooze miles below, I shrieked and shrieked lest the hidden face rise above the waters, and lest the hidden eyes look at me after the slinking away of that leering and treacherous yellow moon.

say:4	start:6	0	 Most people would say it started with the Fireflies, but they'd be wrong.

think:23	come:27	0	 I could see into his head better than I could see into my own; he was scared that his attackers might think those hands were coming up to hit back, that they'd read it as an act of defiance and hurt him even more.

be sure:4	avoid:8	0	 I was pretty sure he'd been avoiding me.

know:28	game:33	0	 So I picked up a rock the size of my fist and hit two of Pag's assailants across the backs of their heads before anyone even knew I was in the game.

think:4	have:7	0	 We seem to think moral questions have correct answers; that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts; that moral facts are wholly determined by circumstances; and that, by engaging in moral conversation and argument, we can discover what these objective facts are.

think:14	objective:19	1	 But as we have seen above, evolutionary theory explains why we would think that moral judgments are objective.

show:8	something:16	1	 The philosopher Michael Ruse takes this to show that the apparent objectivity of morality is something like an “illusion” foisted on us by our genes (Ruse [1986] 1998, 253).

show:13	objective:19	1	 Of course, even if Ruse is correct, this does not show that moral judgments are not objective, but it can make us think whether the objectivity of morality really has to be explained, as many philosophers assume.

think:26	have:33	0	 Of course, even if Ruse is correct, this does not show that moral judgments are not objective, but it can make us think whether the objectivity of morality really has to be explained, as many philosophers assume.

suggest:11	be:14	1	 Ruse has also argued that an evolutionary account of morality suggests that there are no moral facts in the first place.

believe:15	be:17	0	 If moral facts are explanatorily redundant, indeed, moral realists (those who believe there are mind-independent, objective facts about morality, as discussed in Chapter 1) need to say why we should still suppose that moral facts do exist.

suppose:40	exist:45	1	 If moral facts are explanatorily redundant, indeed, moral realists (those who believe there are mind-independent, objective facts about morality, as discussed in Chapter 1) need to say why we should still suppose that moral facts do exist.

show:15	false:21	1	 Relatedly, Sharon Street, for example, argues that evolutionary explanations of morality show that moral realism is probably false.

think:37	wrong:43	1	 The kind of moral realism that Street has in mind is the view that moral properties exist as objective features of the world (to wit, whether stealing is wrong is independent of whether anyone thinks or feels that stealing is wrong).

assume:12	true:18	1	 In light of the coincidence, we have no reason to assume that our moral judgments are true—an unpalatable conclusion for realists.

claim:1	be:4	1	 Claiming that there is a relation, however, is empirically dubious, according to Street.

suppose:1	assume:5	1	 Suppose that moral realists assume that there is no relation between our moral judgments and the moral facts.

assume:5	be:8	1	 Suppose that moral realists assume that there is no relation between our moral judgments and the moral facts.

claim:2	much:10	1	 Street claims that such a coincidence would be too much to believe.

give:1	influence:7	1	 Given that our moral beliefs are influenced by evolutionary forces, and not by the moral facts, our moral beliefs would be the same even if the moral facts would change.

show:17	unjustified:23	1	 But because we should not hold on to such insensitive beliefs, evolutionary explanations of morality show that our moral beliefs are unjustified (because they are not sensitive).

see:10	raise:14	1	 Once we get into the details, we can see that it also raises deep theoretical questions about evolutionary explanations, the relation of descriptive and normative claims, the epistemology of justification and truth, and the general viability of naturalism in ethics.

think:4	space:8	1	 Einstein preferred to think that it is space and time that are affected by the presence of a large mass; light beams, and everything else that travels through space and time, then find their paths affected.

say:1	want:3	0	 Say you want to fly from Chicago to Rome.

explain:2	Avenue:10	1	 You explain that your dorm is at 6400 College Avenue, a street that runs in the left-right direction on a map of your town; you are on the fifth floor, which tells where you are in the up-down direction; and you are the sixth room back from the elevator, which tells where you are in the forward-backward direction.

explain:3	break:7	1	 Then you explain that the fire broke out at 6:23 p.m. (but was soon brought under control), which specifies the event in time.

show:3	be:6	1	 But Einstein showed that there is an intimate connection between space and time, and that only by considering the two together—in what we call spacetime—can we build up a correct picture of the physical world.
