note:11	feel:34	1	 Besides the enjambment types above, Spang (1983) noted that if a subject or direct object and their related verbs occur in two different lines of poetry, this can also feel unusual for a reader, even if the effect is less pronounced than in the environments identified by Quilis.

ensure:37	take:41	1	 For instance, those with an interest in deceiving the general public may set up parallel institutions that ostensibly guarantee expertise, taking advantage of the ways in which these parallel institutions mimic legitimate institutions to ensure that people are taken in.

think:31	speak:35	1	 Such an organization is surely permissible, but it has had the unfortunate (and likely intended) effect of muddying debates in the public forum by misleading people into thinking that the college speaks for the pediatric profession at large.

indicate:7	difficult:9	0	 The controversy surrounding Beall’s decision indicates how difficult it is to make such judgments — even for professionals.

note:18	publish:22	1	 Since conflicts of interest are a reason to discount expertise, it is incumbent on me to note that I have published in Frontiers journals on several occasions.

suggest:16	have:20	1	 With respect to the contributions of digital games to improvement of cognitive processes, researchers suggest that regular practice has a significant influence on improving the performance related to basic visual skills (Li, Polat, Scalzo, & Bavelier, 2010); on the ability to perceive objects simultaneously (Dye & Bavelier, 2010; Feng, Spence, & Pratt, 2007); and on the ability to do more than one task at the same time (Boot, Kramer, Simons, Fabiani, & Gratton, 2008).

have:30	60.23:35	0	 The difference in the results obtained from the application of D2 Test of attention before and after was statistically significant (p < 0.05), the participant group had mean and standard deviation 60.23 (64.75) respectively, while the control group was 20.00 (42.65).

conclude:5	offer:14	1	 From this, we conclude that an intervention based on cognitive digital games offers contributions to the learning process and improvement of sustained attention.

suggest:15	word:57	1	 From a systematic comparison of 10 spoken languages from 5 continents we find evidence suggesting that a word like ‘Huh?’ – used as a ‘repair initiator’ when, for example, one has not clearly heard what someone just said [5], [6] – is a universal word.

show:9	great:30	1	 In support of the first claim, we show that the similarities in form and function of an interjection with the specific function of repair initiation are very much greater across languages than chance coincidence would admit.

show:9	meet:13	1	 In support of the second claim, we show that Huh? meets the criteria of a word in the sense of being a conventional lexical sign which must be learnt.

find:36	linguistic:41	1	 Thus, in contrast to what has been presumed for interjections in general [7], [8] and for huh? in particular [9], [10], we find that this item is linguistic in nature rather than being a mere grunt or non-lexical sound.

show:2	calibrate:8	1	 We show that the form is locally calibrated in ways that show it fitting within different language systems.

observe:2	fulfil:6	1	 We observe that this item fulfils a crucial need shared by all languages – the efficient signalling of problems of hearing and understanding – and we propose that its form is constrained by selective pressures in a conversational environment that is essentially the same in all languages.

propose:27	constrain:32	1	 We observe that this item fulfils a crucial need shared by all languages – the efficient signalling of problems of hearing and understanding – and we propose that its form is constrained by selective pressures in a conversational environment that is essentially the same in all languages.

signal:29	be:32	1	 repair is initiated not by the speaker of the first turn but by the other participant (“other-initiated”), and the repair initiator signals that there is a problem, but it leaves open what the problem is (“open”) [11].

show:3	possible:7	1	 These examples show that it is possible to identify the same conversational structure in unrelated languages.

find:8	appear:26	1	 By compiling data from published literature we found that in thirty-one languages around the world, the interjection for other-initiated repair appears to be strongly similar (Figure 1).

make sure:25	compare:28	0	 Such alternative (and probably derived) uses provide insight in possible paths of semantic change, but we exclude them here to make sure we are comparing like with like.

expect:2	guide:18	1	 We expected that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity over providing truth value judgments, and would result in adult-like interpretations.

find:12	respond:15	1	 however, in the study by Hein and colleagues it was found that children responded more or less frequently based on factors such as stimuli type.

believe:14	produce:20	1	 It is possible that these two children understood the task and really did believe that the puppet did not produce any poor descriptions, and in this regard, are not yet adult-like in their SI interpretations.

say:6	say:14	1	 This is unlikely as they said that even the first training item was said well.

demonstrate:18	follow:24	1	 Albeit limited, these results provide valuable insight into SI interpretation by Chitonga-speaking children and demonstrate that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order identified in previous research, but appears to be completed at a later age in this language.

seem:22	necessity:28	1	 In fact, someone’s productivity, particularly at night, depends on the presence of a good lighting and it seems that it is a daily necessity.

check:7	correct:13	1	 It simulates the error of not checking that the coordinate system is correct.

give:20	influential:31	1	 The narrative review considers challenges in replication research and is largely informed by commentaries and metascience from psychology, given that the cognitive and social subdomains of psychology are highly influential in L2 research, and also from education, another key sister discipline.

mean:20	surface:32	1	 In addition, the widely used empirical models decouple the wind effect from SSS and SST effects, which means that the surface emission is due to a perfectly flat sea surface and the wind-roughened sea surface.

show:3	produce:14	1	 We have shown that the addition of an artificial tail during ontogeny can produce postural and locomotory changes in chickens, consistent with the posture and kinematics inferred for non-avian dinosaurs [5], [6], [11].

conclude:4	factor:15	1	 Therefore, we conclude that the location of the CoM can be a key factor in defining limb posture and kinematics.

show:3	affect:16	1	 Our data show that for a given CFL mass, femoral retraction can be greatly affected by the location of the CoM and limb postures.

suggest:8	increase:12	1	 Experimental manipulations of femoral orientation in chickens suggest that torsional loads increase as the femur becomes more horizontal [7] supporting the idea that postural differences could be reflected in differences in limb cross-sectional geometry.

consider:6	fail:20	1	 Maybe this is not surprising considering that a recent study analyzing the relationship between posture and femur cross-sectional properties failed to find differences between birds and non-avian theropods [24], suggesting that simple morphological correlates of limb posture should be used with caution.

suggest:33	use:43	1	 Maybe this is not surprising considering that a recent study analyzing the relationship between posture and femur cross-sectional properties failed to find differences between birds and non-avian theropods [24], suggesting that simple morphological correlates of limb posture should be used with caution.

suggest:22	reduce:26	1	 Longer limbs are expected to experience larger bending and torsional moments, so the fact that experimental animals had longer femora suggests that limb verticalization reduces these moments by orienting the bone more parallel to the GRF line of action.

suggest:2	due:8	1	 We suggest that the different outcomes are due to the distinct rearing and exercising conditions used in each study, in addition to the different artificial tails used.

suggest:2	explain:9	1	 This suggests that their results could be partially explained as a response to the increased loading rather than to the displacement of the CoM.

show:37	recreate:48	1	 It has even been proposed that, due to functional convergence, mammals might be a better system to study bipedal dinosaur locomotion [7], [23], but the results reported here show that important aspects of non-avian theropod locomotion can be experimentally recreated in modern birds.

mean:6	have:10	1	 Nonetheless, this does not mean that tail reduction had no effect on CoM displacement, but that it was not the most important factor.

argue:2	effective:13	1	 We argue that our experimental approach, although not perfect, was effective in displacing the CoM and recreating locomotor patterns expected in non-avian theropods.

expect:4	open:13	1	 Thus, we expect that careful phenotypic manipulation of extant birds can open new avenues of experimental investigation into unexplored facets of dinosaur locomotor mechanics and energetics, providing a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between form and function in dinosaur evolution.

say:6	more:14	1	 It is no exaggeration to say that HBO’s Game of Thrones is more than just a television series or a successful brand:

forget:13	adaptation:21	1	 Given the volume of content this represents, it is easy to forget that the television series itself is an adaptation of a book series with a pre-existing fandom.

note:21	related:34	1	 To investigate this, Daniel experimented by puncturing the wall of a pipe with a small open ended straw and noted that the height to which the fluid rose up the straw was related to fluid's pressure in the pipe.

realise:2	exchange:12	1	 Daniel realised that in a similar way, a moving fluid exchanges its kinetic energy for pressure.

seem:31	have:36	1	 After his expulsion became official in January 1831, he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest, but this waned, as it seemed that his political activism had priority. [4] [7]

declare:15	clear:26	1	 Around 4 July 1831, Poisson declared Galois' work "incomprehensible", declaring that "[Galois'] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor"; however, the rejection report ends on an encouraging note: "We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion." [16]

suggest:54	publish:59	1	 Around 4 July 1831, Poisson declared Galois' work "incomprehensible", declaring that "[Galois'] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor"; however, the rejection report ends on an encouraging note: "We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion." [16]

see:33	have:37	1	 And as I ran along the shore, crushing sleeping flowers with heedless feet and maddened ever by the fear of unknown things and the lure of the dead faces, I saw that the garden had no end under that moon; for where by day the walls were, there stretched now only new vistas of trees and paths, flowers and shrubs, stone idols and pagodas, and bendings of the yellow-litten stream past grassy banks and under grotesque bridges of marble.

think:4	have:7	0	 We seem to think moral questions have correct answers; that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts; that moral facts are wholly determined by circumstances; and that, by engaging in moral conversation and argument, we can discover what these objective facts are.

think:14	objective:19	1	 But as we have seen above, evolutionary theory explains why we would think that moral judgments are objective.

show:8	something:16	1	 The philosopher Michael Ruse takes this to show that the apparent objectivity of morality is something like an “illusion” foisted on us by our genes (Ruse [1986] 1998, 253).

show:13	objective:19	1	 Of course, even if Ruse is correct, this does not show that moral judgments are not objective, but it can make us think whether the objectivity of morality really has to be explained, as many philosophers assume.

think:26	have:33	0	 Of course, even if Ruse is correct, this does not show that moral judgments are not objective, but it can make us think whether the objectivity of morality really has to be explained, as many philosophers assume.

suggest:11	be:14	1	 Ruse has also argued that an evolutionary account of morality suggests that there are no moral facts in the first place.

believe:15	be:17	0	 If moral facts are explanatorily redundant, indeed, moral realists (those who believe there are mind-independent, objective facts about morality, as discussed in Chapter 1) need to say why we should still suppose that moral facts do exist.

suppose:40	exist:45	1	 If moral facts are explanatorily redundant, indeed, moral realists (those who believe there are mind-independent, objective facts about morality, as discussed in Chapter 1) need to say why we should still suppose that moral facts do exist.

argue:9	show:15	1	 Relatedly, Sharon Street, for example, argues that evolutionary explanations of morality show that moral realism is probably false.

show:15	false:21	1	 Relatedly, Sharon Street, for example, argues that evolutionary explanations of morality show that moral realism is probably false.

think:37	wrong:43	1	 The kind of moral realism that Street has in mind is the view that moral properties exist as objective features of the world (to wit, whether stealing is wrong is independent of whether anyone thinks or feels that stealing is wrong).

assume:12	true:18	1	 In light of the coincidence, we have no reason to assume that our moral judgments are true—an unpalatable conclusion for realists.

claim:1	be:4	1	 Claiming that there is a relation, however, is empirically dubious, according to Street.

suppose:1	assume:5	1	 Suppose that moral realists assume that there is no relation between our moral judgments and the moral facts.

assume:5	be:8	1	 Suppose that moral realists assume that there is no relation between our moral judgments and the moral facts.

claim:2	much:10	1	 Street claims that such a coincidence would be too much to believe.

argue:5	have:9	1	 The philosopher Richard Joyce argues that the problem has to do with the sensitivity of our moral beliefs to the moral facts (Joyce 2006).

give:1	influence:7	1	 Given that our moral beliefs are influenced by evolutionary forces, and not by the moral facts, our moral beliefs would be the same even if the moral facts would change.

show:17	unjustified:23	1	 But because we should not hold on to such insensitive beliefs, evolutionary explanations of morality show that our moral beliefs are unjustified (because they are not sensitive).

be clear:4	reveal:15	0	 It is not clear, however, whether and why evolutionary explanations of morality reveal something about our moral beliefs that is particularly troubling from an epistemological perspective.

see:10	raise:14	1	 Once we get into the details, we can see that it also raises deep theoretical questions about evolutionary explanations, the relation of descriptive and normative claims, the epistemology of justification and truth, and the general viability of naturalism in ethics.

explain:3	break:7	1	 Then you explain that the fire broke out at 6:23 p.m. (but was soon brought under control), which specifies the event in time.

show:3	be:6	1	 But Einstein showed that there is an intimate connection between space and time, and that only by considering the two together—in what we call spacetime—can we build up a correct picture of the physical world.

pray:32	bomb:40	0	 Even the IP and ICDC have abandoned the neighbourhood, and those are trained and armed, so don't expect scared civilians to do anything except to hide inside and pray a helicopter or a tank doesn't bomb them, and also how are American soldiers going to distinguish the brave and valiant civilians from the Fedayeen?

know:19	glad:24	1	 What irritates me is this sudden false 'solidarity' between Sunni and Shi'ite clerics, we all know that they would be glad to get at each others throats when they have the chance, and Shia clerics were describing Fallujan insurgents as 'Ba'athists', 'Saddamites', 'Wahhabis', and 'terrorists' just a few days ago.

guess:2	thing:44	0	 I guess it's just the old new Arab 'Me against my brother, me and my brother against my cousin, me and my cousin against my enemy', or 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' thing going on again.

argue:30	know:33	1	 Indeed, given how Bush has rampaged around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the potential to blow back on the US, one might well argue that Edwards knows more now than Bush does.

believe:15	leader:23	1	 This is what Edwards' campaign literature said about his positions: "Edwards believes that the U.S. must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts, from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland.

say:36	reiteration:45	0	 A veteran of India's military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment.

say:17	remain:34	0	 Kalkat, who currently chairs the independent US-based International Council on Conflict Resolution, said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers, India remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks.

understand:38	acceptance:47	0	 Realists, and this even includes members of the U.S. Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott, who have long sought to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia, understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo.

keep:2	have:5	0	 India keeps what it has while Pakistan and China (which was gifted a slice of the territory three decades ago) do likewise.

signal:10	acceptable:18	1	 Since then, India has talked peace while always signaling that only the status quo would be acceptable as a final settlement: a line of action that is followed in the case of disputes with China as well.

show:6	have:9	1	 Once the Manmohan Singh government shows that it has little appetite for suicide, Musharraf will face the moment of truth: accept the inevitable, or once again ramp up the insurgency and spawn a fresh lot of killers that can hit not merely Mumbai and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well.

know:3	serve:7	1	 We all know that John Kerry served in Vietnam.

say:2	solution:9	1	 He said that resistance was the only commonsense solution.

guess:30	what:43	1	 Leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other historical examples in the region, Sunnis have never offered an alternative choice, which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what they are planning to implement.

claim:16	have:19	1	 I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba'athist old-timer who claimed that Ba'athists have the means to stage a third coup d'etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal.

say:2	have:5	1	 He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments.

believe:21	go:25	0	 But I also see that as a fatal misconception, which is doing Sunnis harm, because I don't believe the US is going anywhere so soon.

ensure:39	picture:46	0	 Any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this, so not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops, despite what he is saying now, not until they are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture, or that they have an alternative foreign power (in this case Iran) to back them up.

think:2	look:7	0	 I thought the US government was looking for me.

have:14	write:18	0	 The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that "everyone" is going to "love" the food, decor and service.

think:22	condiment:25	0	 The salatim salads are the smallest plates I've ever seen placed in front of me (you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren't explained to you).

guess:2	tell:4	0	 I guess that tells you a lot.

believe:9	go:12	0	 Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests (and as the many golden reviews seem to attest), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience.

show:6	lead:16	1	 As an example, research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [1] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [2, 3] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers.

argue:7	involve:11	1	 Coase [13,14] argues that economic transactions involve costs, and where these costs outweigh the gains, the exchange will not take place.

believe:11	take:19	1	 In other words, it is critical that economic agents believe that their property rights will not be taken away by other public or private actors [15].

propose:10	give:17	1	 Quilis (1964) performed poetry reading experiments, proposing that the following strongly connected elements give rise to enjambment, should a poetic-form pause break them up:

note:11	feel:34	1	 Besides the enjambment types above, Spang (1983) noted that if a subject or direct object and their related verbs occur in two different lines of poetry, this can also feel unusual for a reader, even if the effect is less pronounced than in the environments identified by Quilis.

ensure:37	take:41	1	 For instance, those with an interest in deceiving the general public may set up parallel institutions that ostensibly guarantee expertise, taking advantage of the ways in which these parallel institutions mimic legitimate institutions to ensure that people are taken in.

think:31	speak:35	1	 Such an organization is surely permissible, but it has had the unfortunate (and likely intended) effect of muddying debates in the public forum by misleading people into thinking that the college speaks for the pediatric profession at large.

indicate:7	difficult:9	0	 The controversy surrounding Beall’s decision indicates how difficult it is to make such judgments — even for professionals.

note:18	publish:22	1	 Since conflicts of interest are a reason to discount expertise, it is incumbent on me to note that I have published in Frontiers journals on several occasions.

suggest:16	have:20	1	 With respect to the contributions of digital games to improvement of cognitive processes, researchers suggest that regular practice has a significant influence on improving the performance related to basic visual skills (Li, Polat, Scalzo, & Bavelier, 2010); on the ability to perceive objects simultaneously (Dye & Bavelier, 2010; Feng, Spence, & Pratt, 2007); and on the ability to do more than one task at the same time (Boot, Kramer, Simons, Fabiani, & Gratton, 2008).

have:30	60.23:35	0	 The difference in the results obtained from the application of D2 Test of attention before and after was statistically significant (p < 0.05), the participant group had mean and standard deviation 60.23 (64.75) respectively, while the control group was 20.00 (42.65).

conclude:5	offer:14	1	 From this, we conclude that an intervention based on cognitive digital games offers contributions to the learning process and improvement of sustained attention.

suggest:15	word:57	1	 From a systematic comparison of 10 spoken languages from 5 continents we find evidence suggesting that a word like ‘Huh?’ – used as a ‘repair initiator’ when, for example, one has not clearly heard what someone just said [5], [6] – is a universal word.

show:9	great:30	1	 In support of the first claim, we show that the similarities in form and function of an interjection with the specific function of repair initiation are very much greater across languages than chance coincidence would admit.

show:9	meet:13	1	 In support of the second claim, we show that Huh? meets the criteria of a word in the sense of being a conventional lexical sign which must be learnt.

find:36	linguistic:41	1	 Thus, in contrast to what has been presumed for interjections in general [7], [8] and for huh? in particular [9], [10], we find that this item is linguistic in nature rather than being a mere grunt or non-lexical sound.

show:2	calibrate:8	1	 We show that the form is locally calibrated in ways that show it fitting within different language systems.

observe:2	fulfil:6	1	 We observe that this item fulfils a crucial need shared by all languages – the efficient signalling of problems of hearing and understanding – and we propose that its form is constrained by selective pressures in a conversational environment that is essentially the same in all languages.

propose:27	constrain:32	1	 We observe that this item fulfils a crucial need shared by all languages – the efficient signalling of problems of hearing and understanding – and we propose that its form is constrained by selective pressures in a conversational environment that is essentially the same in all languages.

signal:29	be:32	1	 repair is initiated not by the speaker of the first turn but by the other participant (“other-initiated”), and the repair initiator signals that there is a problem, but it leaves open what the problem is (“open”) [11].

show:3	possible:7	1	 These examples show that it is possible to identify the same conversational structure in unrelated languages.

find:8	appear:26	1	 By compiling data from published literature we found that in thirty-one languages around the world, the interjection for other-initiated repair appears to be strongly similar (Figure 1).

make sure:25	compare:28	0	 Such alternative (and probably derived) uses provide insight in possible paths of semantic change, but we exclude them here to make sure we are comparing like with like.

expect:2	guide:18	1	 We expected that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity over providing truth value judgments, and would result in adult-like interpretations.

find:12	respond:15	1	 however, in the study by Hein and colleagues it was found that children responded more or less frequently based on factors such as stimuli type.

believe:14	produce:20	1	 It is possible that these two children understood the task and really did believe that the puppet did not produce any poor descriptions, and in this regard, are not yet adult-like in their SI interpretations.

say:6	say:14	1	 This is unlikely as they said that even the first training item was said well.

demonstrate:18	follow:24	1	 Albeit limited, these results provide valuable insight into SI interpretation by Chitonga-speaking children and demonstrate that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order identified in previous research, but appears to be completed at a later age in this language.

seem:22	necessity:28	1	 In fact, someone’s productivity, particularly at night, depends on the presence of a good lighting and it seems that it is a daily necessity.

check:7	correct:13	1	 It simulates the error of not checking that the coordinate system is correct.

give:20	influential:31	1	 The narrative review considers challenges in replication research and is largely informed by commentaries and metascience from psychology, given that the cognitive and social subdomains of psychology are highly influential in L2 research, and also from education, another key sister discipline.

mean:20	surface:32	1	 In addition, the widely used empirical models decouple the wind effect from SSS and SST effects, which means that the surface emission is due to a perfectly flat sea surface and the wind-roughened sea surface.

show:3	produce:14	1	 We have shown that the addition of an artificial tail during ontogeny can produce postural and locomotory changes in chickens, consistent with the posture and kinematics inferred for non-avian dinosaurs [5], [6], [11].

conclude:4	factor:15	1	 Therefore, we conclude that the location of the CoM can be a key factor in defining limb posture and kinematics.

show:3	affect:16	1	 Our data show that for a given CFL mass, femoral retraction can be greatly affected by the location of the CoM and limb postures.

suggest:8	increase:12	1	 Experimental manipulations of femoral orientation in chickens suggest that torsional loads increase as the femur becomes more horizontal [7] supporting the idea that postural differences could be reflected in differences in limb cross-sectional geometry.

consider:6	fail:20	1	 Maybe this is not surprising considering that a recent study analyzing the relationship between posture and femur cross-sectional properties failed to find differences between birds and non-avian theropods [24], suggesting that simple morphological correlates of limb posture should be used with caution.

suggest:33	use:43	1	 Maybe this is not surprising considering that a recent study analyzing the relationship between posture and femur cross-sectional properties failed to find differences between birds and non-avian theropods [24], suggesting that simple morphological correlates of limb posture should be used with caution.

suggest:22	reduce:26	1	 Longer limbs are expected to experience larger bending and torsional moments, so the fact that experimental animals had longer femora suggests that limb verticalization reduces these moments by orienting the bone more parallel to the GRF line of action.

suggest:2	due:8	1	 We suggest that the different outcomes are due to the distinct rearing and exercising conditions used in each study, in addition to the different artificial tails used.

suggest:2	explain:9	1	 This suggests that their results could be partially explained as a response to the increased loading rather than to the displacement of the CoM.

show:37	recreate:48	1	 It has even been proposed that, due to functional convergence, mammals might be a better system to study bipedal dinosaur locomotion [7], [23], but the results reported here show that important aspects of non-avian theropod locomotion can be experimentally recreated in modern birds.

argue:2	effective:13	1	 We argue that our experimental approach, although not perfect, was effective in displacing the CoM and recreating locomotor patterns expected in non-avian theropods.

think:4	have:7	0	 We seem to think moral questions have correct answers; that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts; that moral facts are wholly determined by circumstances; and that, by engaging in moral conversation and argument, we can discover what these objective facts are.

think:14	objective:19	1	 But as we have seen above, evolutionary theory explains why we would think that moral judgments are objective.

show:8	something:16	1	 The philosopher Michael Ruse takes this to show that the apparent objectivity of morality is something like an “illusion” foisted on us by our genes (Ruse [1986] 1998, 253).

show:13	objective:19	1	 Of course, even if Ruse is correct, this does not show that moral judgments are not objective, but it can make us think whether the objectivity of morality really has to be explained, as many philosophers assume.

think:26	have:33	0	 Of course, even if Ruse is correct, this does not show that moral judgments are not objective, but it can make us think whether the objectivity of morality really has to be explained, as many philosophers assume.

suggest:11	be:14	1	 Ruse has also argued that an evolutionary account of morality suggests that there are no moral facts in the first place.

believe:15	be:17	0	 If moral facts are explanatorily redundant, indeed, moral realists (those who believe there are mind-independent, objective facts about morality, as discussed in Chapter 1) need to say why we should still suppose that moral facts do exist.

suppose:40	exist:45	1	 If moral facts are explanatorily redundant, indeed, moral realists (those who believe there are mind-independent, objective facts about morality, as discussed in Chapter 1) need to say why we should still suppose that moral facts do exist.

argue:9	show:15	1	 Relatedly, Sharon Street, for example, argues that evolutionary explanations of morality show that moral realism is probably false.

show:15	false:21	1	 Relatedly, Sharon Street, for example, argues that evolutionary explanations of morality show that moral realism is probably false.

think:37	wrong:43	1	 The kind of moral realism that Street has in mind is the view that moral properties exist as objective features of the world (to wit, whether stealing is wrong is independent of whether anyone thinks or feels that stealing is wrong).

assume:12	true:18	1	 In light of the coincidence, we have no reason to assume that our moral judgments are true—an unpalatable conclusion for realists.

claim:1	be:4	1	 Claiming that there is a relation, however, is empirically dubious, according to Street.

suppose:1	assume:5	1	 Suppose that moral realists assume that there is no relation between our moral judgments and the moral facts.

assume:5	be:8	1	 Suppose that moral realists assume that there is no relation between our moral judgments and the moral facts.

claim:2	much:10	1	 Street claims that such a coincidence would be too much to believe.

argue:5	have:9	1	 The philosopher Richard Joyce argues that the problem has to do with the sensitivity of our moral beliefs to the moral facts (Joyce 2006).

give:1	influence:7	1	 Given that our moral beliefs are influenced by evolutionary forces, and not by the moral facts, our moral beliefs would be the same even if the moral facts would change.

show:17	unjustified:23	1	 But because we should not hold on to such insensitive beliefs, evolutionary explanations of morality show that our moral beliefs are unjustified (because they are not sensitive).

be clear:4	reveal:15	0	 It is not clear, however, whether and why evolutionary explanations of morality reveal something about our moral beliefs that is particularly troubling from an epistemological perspective.

see:10	raise:14	1	 Once we get into the details, we can see that it also raises deep theoretical questions about evolutionary explanations, the relation of descriptive and normative claims, the epistemology of justification and truth, and the general viability of naturalism in ethics.

explain:3	break:7	1	 Then you explain that the fire broke out at 6:23 p.m. (but was soon brought under control), which specifies the event in time.

show:3	be:6	1	 But Einstein showed that there is an intimate connection between space and time, and that only by considering the two together—in what we call spacetime—can we build up a correct picture of the physical world.

tell:17	one:22	1	 Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission's priorities in the field of transport.

make:49	improve:51	0	 In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.

see:7	improve:20	0	 Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.

say:7	have:10	1	 Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.

say:6	objective:12	1	 But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.

make:9	apply:13	0	 Delays in the CEN's work are now making it difficult to apply this very Directive.

ensure:5	be:8	1	 We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.

ensure:7	continue:28	1	 A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this Directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.

use:31	construct:37	1	 A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this Directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.

imagine:12	fall:18	1	 On the shores of the Mediterranean, it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.

propose:4	lower:10	1	 I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40° C.

think:2	superb:7	1	 I thought that it was quite superb.

think:8	able:16	1	 On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.

make:2	take:7	0	 This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.

hope:2	able:7	1	 I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.

believe:16	incorporate:20	1	 Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.

say:5	urge:24	1	 I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda's comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.

see:3	widen:10	0	 We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.

seem:10	hide:17	0	 We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.

ensure:8	be:11	1	 We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.

ensure:12	involve:32	1	 We look to it to challenge the UK Government, to ensure that the private sector, which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure, is involved in the planning stage.

ask:4	ensure:8	1	 Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.

ensure:8	spend:14	1	 Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.

make:59	remain:66	0	 We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee's proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.

hope:2	have:10	1	 We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.

hope:2	reassure:7	1	 We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.

believe:26	one:42	1	 In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.

feel:2	important:6	1	 We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.

think:17	participate:43	1	 In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative.

suggest:2	go:5	0	 I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the Regulation.

be:3	make:7	1	 The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.

state:7	hear:12	1	 The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.

consider:4	take:8	0	 Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.

demand:14	study:32	1	 Bearing this in mind, this House should, in any event, demand that, before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved, they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament, specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today.

forget:7	objective:13	0	 Mr President, we should not forget that the main, strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.

feel:2	condition:11	1	 We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.

mean:3	act:15	1	 This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.

agree:2	have:9	1	 I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the Directives.

think:4	come:12	1	 I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.

agree:3	ask:7	1	 We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the Directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives.

think:5	agree:19	1	 I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.

remember:24	play:31	1	 In conclusion, while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.

. be:9	prefer:14	1	 The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the Regulation in the form of an annex, as we and Mrs Mccarthy, as rapporteurs for the general Regulation, had asked.

be certain:4	observe:10	1	 I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.

know:2	do:6	0	 I know many have already done so, but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides, and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.

say:8	enter:12	1	 In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.

think:3	ensure:6	0	 I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.

mean:2	allow:7	1	 This means that we don't allow joint accounts.

appear:17	determine:29	1	 (5) Action should be taken during the design phase of EUPs, since it appears that the pollution caused during a product's life cycle is determined at that stage, and most of the costs involved are committed then.

advise:31	use:36	0	 (10) In order to maximise the environmental benefits from improved design it may be necessary to inform consumers about the environmental characteristics and performance of EUPs and to advise them about how to use products in a manner which is environmentally friendly.

say:9	have:12	1	 It is true, but unhelpful, to say that governments have only themselves to blame for having recklessly rushed into this wild ride.

claim:18	obstacle:24	1	 Some activists and government officials get the relationship between strong IP protection and economic growth backwards, claiming that IP rights are an obstacle to development, and thus should not be enforced until after countries achieve high-income status.

recognize:12	prerequisite:19	1	 Instead of diluting IP rights, developing countries like India should recognize that strengthening IP protection is a prerequisite for attracting the foreign investment that they need to help their economies grow, create jobs, and improve their citizens'capacity to consume.

suspect:21	true:26	0	 China emerged from the late-1990's Asian financial crisis as the region's most resilient economy, and I suspect the same will be true this time.

see:16	fall:30	0	 A century earlier, the French physiocrats Quesnay, Turgot, and Condorcet did not see how the share of the French labor force employed in agriculture could possibly fall below 50% without producing social ruin.

be:7	continue:14	1	 And today, the optimistic view is that those with excess wealth will continue to think of lots of things for everyone else to do to make their lives more convenient and luxurious, and that the ingenuity of the rich will outstrip the supply of labor by the poor and turn the poor into the middle class.
