um but they don't always work and then you know they try to raise taxes more and i don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work you know and the taxes get raised
his it kind of shows how his um best friend this little girl deals with his death and how i think maybe how children should deal with death maybe
oh i don't know well i'm used to it now but sometimes it still gets gets to me but there's not much i can really do no
oh me too i hope that happens to me someday i mean i don't mind doing stuff um i have a boyfriend and like i'll make him dinner and stuff but you know and he'll help me do the dishes i don't want him you know
really neat to seeing all what educated minority um person who really knows what they're talking about and
oh i don't know yeah i know who you're talking about
no i never did didn't have the i guess i didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing and of course i was at that you know stage of my life where i had to be taken places places i couldn't go by myself but
well i don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not
yeah i well i have in a while for a while i haven't gotten any because i just find that i'm not reading what i'm getting because uh
um i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight or or should i say seven i mean she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's gonna excel just naturally she does have to really work at it but
and after it started to sprout put in sunny window and it's it just grew like crazy but i don't have any flowers on it i don't know how long that takes or if there's anything i need to do differently but
i don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than uh what are some of the things they don't recycle oh one thing i thought about the other day were batteries just everyday regular batteries
and you know and as the kids got older i made them you know help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too
they say uh it football attracts more men because of the you know you the you see the the physical aggression on the field and supposedly psychologists say that uh
the uh teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them and it's very important i feel
and uh you know you hear in the newspaper you hear on the and you read the newspaper quite often of of people that you know
we've uh we've been married for about ten years and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh
and uh i've seen what it has done in other countries and so i don't think uh
you know a a quality difference i don't know you wouldn't you didn't notice the difference did you
well guess what we get to talk about the weather uh
lights up the whole sky and even on a on a actually i've i've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky it's a cloudless night
and and yes all those areas so i imagine have you skied before
where they buy something now and say well i'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale and then i can go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month when i'm being paid
well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldn't be able to do that
he's a he's a medical doctor right now he had to you know once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree he had to take out some loans and he's he's working to pay those off
you know once you get past uh the initial stages of it that there's different options you can use and and uh the student loans are are a good option and
and we do do that fact i was just reading an article you mentioned painting your bathroom
no i don't think so um i started playing when i was in elementary school actually we lived really close to a par three golf course and i'd go up there with friends after school a couple times every week and then
well you know you it seems like well you go to work every weekend play maybe one two tournaments a month and come in about tenth you'd still be doing pretty well
you know buy keep auto workers working right now but i feel that the have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while if i were to buy another car i would be uh
i believe it i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually
uh i know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten late years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but
double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well that's great that's gonna lower our national expenditures but then you're gonna have people on welfare and they're not putting taxes in
well you know i i can see how they can say in the work place we you don't want them to smoke but when somebody leaves work i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their lifestyle at all
yeah i mean that's better than who came out and said no i will not read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i can't follow through on this but it seems to me that uh
and then i'm gonna go on and just forget everything that i said or you know it doesn't seem that it's gonna make much of a difference
yeah i mean even even if it's just little details it seems like uh they you know like uh there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while and and it's clearly just a a design problem there
it's you know we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but
because uh i guess um i mean well ninety two's granted but the new ones you know fourteen to sixteen is what they go for
guess the dealer comes out okay you know i don't know what kind of i don't know what corporate kind of hit the i don't know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off of it
i don't know if you've heard of but it's a very transient community a lot of people from everywhere it's just north of
uh not that i am but other people seem to be and i would love to know why but i mean they do they have i i would i really would i mean they just have beautiful beautiful homes and they have everything
the kids only wear name brand things to school and it's one of these things well it does you know it really does because i'm a single mom and i have a thirteen year old now and uh you know it does i mean we do it to a point but um
and so i just find this a real problem i think if they're gonna be there all day they should find time
uh i don't know if you have that up there but it's it's a very good company that sells sterling silver things and
and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to and i never did i just went back and signed the papers and i knew nothing about my car when i got it nothing i didn't know how anything worked
i know what i'm seeing here at my well my job is that people are having their children much later in life
yes i'm i'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden
another state i can't remember but she told me about the we talked about basketball
i have i was trying to think of the one i went to a couple of weeks ago but i forgot it already
well it would be a lot fun you know there's there's good and there's bad and my experience in wasn't my favorite for sure but
we didn't know we looked at each other we said things like spaghetti you know things like that and we finally followed some kids he told us where to get off we followed these kids with uh gym bags and we figured that must be the sports arena
you never know yeah yeah she feels that way you know and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with but
we just feel better doing it this way so i don't know what day we'll stop we we were about to stop one day this year and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats and so
it's very wealthy town and we're not part of that but i it is you know and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better
to buy a home and and to raise a family i don't know how they're gonna do it
and so i don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again i don't think that ever will go backwards
but i don't know what effect it's gonna have on these kids now when they grow up how they're gonna feel about it
it you know it could lead to another type thing you know where where there's just too much material things and and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things
and you knew how you knew how to do the framing
i'm i'm not sure i understand what you mean
i do think yeah that's true i think in places i think in places like people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off
well that's exactly what i was going to say now there seem to be really three reasons for education one is education for civic duty one is education for economic reasons and one is education for civilization i mean and i think that one is
i don't know if i would rank that second but um since i have three boys uh it it can turn out to be important you know in a in a given year dental can dental expenses can really kill you
you know the like how they said the more i hear about it
uh you know what i miss though basements
is that what happens up there a lot uh that's that that's mostly what i hear about is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen that's the most prevalent crime uh
a good uh a good way for vengeance you know for the relatives and and family members you know what i mean
that's a little bit to uh it it's like they're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing you know what i mean
you know when they had that the music and stuff like that and the and that kind of rock and roll so he likes that and my mom always liked that kind of stuff my mom likes like uh
and know what they're doing with that
so i'm always behind i'm i'm not i'm never really up to date on all that stuff but i know what i like when it's uh when i like a sound a certain kind of sound yeah
you know if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look you know i want my name unlisted or i want my you know
uh well i'm in graduate school and so i read a lot of books but i don't know if i consider very many of them good
i haven't read a book for enjoyment since i guess around um i received received uh
uh uh blues are okay i tell you i do like um i grew up on blue grass music my dad is a big blue grass fan and so um
uh-huh yeah i i agree with you i you know i would even think that um uh i could in theory take that alone a you know a step further and say anybody in any job you know if the corporation felt like uh and and this is why i mean uh drugs are
the biggest problem i think to face today i mean it's what drives crime it's what drives
uh yeah you know whether whether in in the case that you brought up you know whether uh you know whether if it's a policeman and he's working with uh the public and he has a and has a gun in his holster or or even you know if it's a guy at cooking a burger i think
um-hum do you do you worry do you worry any about uh uh you
um-hum although lately i have noticed you know even if i gain like two pounds i start i start feeling it and
yeah there are um i'm living in a dorm right now and so right downstairs there's a facility and i really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than i do because there's a facility right downstairs where all you know all we have to do is
of what's happening with air pollution and how uh how horrible it really is um i i notice people in in seem to say well sure there's air pollution but you know
yeah that is good i i like uh we have cable i really like watching the old at shows you know where you get to watch and and
yeah he published a paper uh couple of years ago i think didn't he well well one that i read does he publish a little quite a bit
i haven't seen that much change you know what i mean i'm kind of young still i don't know what how much it changed in the last
people's uh views on on relationships has changed you know and now we have now we have several you know we we have to worry about and we have to worry about
yeah and i like to listen to that and catch you know you i don't get i don't get a lot of uh sometimes i don't get the current events you know because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with uh
uh which i like i don't i don't like to you know i like to save the editorial information or the the politically uh weighted information you know for the for a different section i like just to get to the you know find out what's happening
no no that's the problem uh you you know you see you see knee surgery on the front page you know
you know how how about you uh i guess in you guys have several papers that are pretty
you know typically you if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself
um-hum yeah that that seems to make sense that leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the uh kind of the rate for different incidents
you know we're we're much better off playing uh ninth that's right you know we'll we'll do we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and and hum it
right luckily i don't either i mean you know maybe my cat would get sick but i mean usually that's not so much that it would throw me off
but you so you know what i'm saying yeah
well this is another way that i'm making a little extra money so that was you know nice that i tripped over this opportunity and you're actually my first call
she grabbed a hold of this and it was kind of funny when i look back at it but i mean i remember the patient getting very upset
just really upset i mean he's what the hell are you think you're doing you know and i laughed at it then but then i'm thinking you know if i had to put my parents in that nursing home i wouldn't want them there
right an unlimited source so they they think well i'll go out and buy a four hundred dollar toilet seat and i could have went to and bought it for you know ten or fifteen i mean that kind of thing and uh
that mark up their amounts and say you know i'll give you a legal pad for five bucks and you can go to another shop and get if for maybe sixty cents or ninety or ninety cents that kind of thing so
but you're still gonna owe the government as much money so by the end of this coming year what's gonna happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings uh account
and each state take care of itself and no government type of uh you know where you have to pay out to federal or whatever i don't know who knows but
is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well you know
this is kind of iffy you know are they really on drugs or are they on you know what i'm saying where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person
uh is on drugs or make up they may make up their mind that let's get rid of this employee you know what i'm saying
exactly and it's a they can that uh if it does come out positive the first time they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take you know what i mean it it's kind of like
if you're watching for the weather even though it's very hard to predict what's going on they'll kind of say well there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever this is the what is expected but a lot of times things happen and change here
you know where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever so
anyway i don't know if our time is getting up here or it's got to be fairly close to that
i don't know if you feel the same but uh when it comes to telling kids that they have to do uh two or three years of service into some kind of community i don't know if that's
and to me that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year but to tell them that they had to do two years there after post high school of community service i'm
judges have said well you know this is what you're gonna get for um you know a misdemeanor misdemeanor or something you may end up having to do some kind of community service so i could see that as
because sometimes i wonder you know being a uh lay person out there of not uh knowing exactly exactly what's going on in space
to me the all this uh space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth
and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space and what it you know not that i want everything to halt and
mainly because uh the space program has taught us that there is no other place for us i mean this is it i mean if we would've
it's it brings down the fact that this earth is it it's it for us you know what i mean
you know and uh i think of uh i i'm sure you probably have heard of the program that's going on currently out in the desert uh
i don't know how many people could live up in space uh for any length of time i mean i
it leads you to kind of say well i'm not going to take it out i'm going to keep it and uh keep it in there and let it grow so that some way
it's put into our savings account and we don't see it then it works out to where you know you don't look at it you just look at the checking account and say this is what we have for money and that's it so
uh-huh yeah yeah i know what you mean and that's true i mean yeah it it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position sure
i don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people you know what i'm saying it it's
and it's kind of like we're the first to do it so i don't know if it's done because we're we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for uh
