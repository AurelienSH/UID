yeah i remember that i do
yeah i i find that if i make i have to make myself to realize that it's important to get out there and not you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me
i have so much going on in my life that seems to be the last thing i pick up so i found that i was wasting my money as much as i enjoy them
really a little more economical and we have or i found that i have the time and i kind of enjoyed it over here in i used to live in and it was very confusing very frustrating because i didn't have the
well no it's a it's good as in terms of in terms of uh of a contest i think that uh i personally like hockey better because it has contact it's a contact sport it has the speed
whether and and i think that and i know has a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now
and that's the big thing i think that they they try to promote
hope to never get into that situation where we have to have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children and hope that we can stay in this situation for awhile so
good good glad to hear that i understand are
but i think that there ought to be some control but i still think that uh individuals have a right how do you feel about it
that might cool down some tempers i think a a one day would be sufficient the reason i say that is there's an awful lot of people who go to gun shows
well do you think that there will continue to always be crazies
where we can uh participate in the the profits of the company if we're you know if we've been there a while and we're vested uh which means that you know we have a an interest uh in the company that we can
well i think that uh you have an excellent deal then and the the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs
can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to to help yourself so i think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations
but also i i sometimes sometimes think that uh i enjoy doing that and i like to get out and and uh to work with my hands
um i found out that also on on that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on and and like you said the the news shows that are that are happening and you can read some more about it if you want to
and the nice thing about it too is i knew that i wanted to get into business
personally i have a car right now and i really like it a lot uh i think the really build good cars and i know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole uh
they're operating on a more i mean i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here but i don't really think that that it's
and also i just think it it gets a lot i'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies and i think that it just moves down along a line that
the accuracy i don't know i don't know but i know there are a lot of things that can influence them and i think that a person deserves
and if you could show that i interviewed for a job recently and i was taking
and i was going through a divorce and i just found that running really made me feel good got out a lot of aggression i went to the gym every day and i ran on the treadmill and rode the bike and
no i've done some walking with friends in the past but i find that when you do that you do more chatting than you do exercise and that's not really beneficial
so i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance and i make enough money by the hour to make up for that
knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement and i'm just
we didn't stop and so so um you know it you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen so even though she's twelve she's still a kid so
um we do it all i really think that and i know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers but i still think the mothers
yeah it's it's difficult and i think that i live in actually so
if you're if there's a psychology department or an education department around you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another i guess that's true but uh
but um i'm afraid i'm i'm i'm probably in the minority i actually don't think that we uh pay too much in this country
uh majority of in in i don't think i agree with no uh i wouldn't say that i think i would have said that a few years ago when i was younger i thought it was a
or and i don't believe they do in or either and they don't have the crime problems we do i don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two
uh uh i really think that we need to
and um it's in in in the in the mountains and it's beautiful and uh i hope that i have something like that
yeah uh of course you know with uh with with now uh you you realize that i think it's uh gets to try him next and they do have the death penalty
keep badgering you about it and that aggravates me but i don't know that you could call that invading of my invading my privacy because
being able i mean do you uh obviously you've taken precautions you know or or measures to uh try and pay for your children's education but do you think that that's gonna be enough
yeah yeah a a quarterback for the or for the for the uh you know you know you know what i mean that there's uh local news that
uh you know that's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused and they've got to do more than just having having cops there they've got to kind of change the way people think about it
in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many appeals yeah if if the person who's gonna commit the crime knew that they were gonna be punished severely possibly capital punishment
uh or some incident where someone loses a limb do you think that jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm a dollar figure for losing different body parts it
well it's it's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music
know that no one would deserve to die for for a crime that he committed but uh since i've become a parent and since i've
yeah i think that's that can happen and i think in the nursing home that i worked for
there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs but the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of uh the conservative or whatever could be drug tested
and i don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to uh be self-serving to the community i think that they have their own uh wishes to uh be in the limelight
yeah well that's exactly what happens in government all the time hey blow the whistle on each other oh i hear that you're doing this i've done it but oh boy and it's not going to get out exactly yeah exactly exactly it's uh
i never had an interest in them being in the fact that i knew that guns could kill and i had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns
and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy
come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that but
see i yeah and i also thought that um that would interfere with with college work and
that i need to move on with them and so i found another babysitter and she was wonderful except i thought that there were too many in the home
so we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them on polls will um say that they think that everyone has a right to health care
do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person
i don't think it's done i don't think we run it as a deterrent i mean people say that but i mean if it was really a deterrent i mean i think like horse thieves in the old west you know they saw other horse thieves
or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and and whatnot
do you think that there's any way that uh or do you think there's too much crime now i mean i guess any crime is too much but it's out of control
i keep thinking that there's got to be some way that that a lot of this is
if it's a company you know that they're insured unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance
i i'm serious and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that happen that exist in the in the criminal system today with plea bargaining
and that they have to do something but i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it
i was just going to say that you should see those first uh first if you can
and uh i think that there's too much
and he said that people have no idea he said of of what human sacrifice is you know since being there he's he's learned to what it is to be poor and have nothing and yet those people have
and he said that out here he said that when he comes back he knows that it it's just completely changed his life
now a family i think that like girls today have children and six weeks later they're back to work
and the man said that you know if if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself and then go to and have a hamburger and not thing a thing think a thing about it
and i mean i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands
and i think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again
that is not a drudgery you know that they can enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of
or that they usually have several people they report to that you know that they work together with
you know so i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world and the business world then says we're not going to pay you
i don't uh there's there's a point on which we don't agree i would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a anytime a
so i'm i'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we uh take that you know that would require a change in the of i believe and so
right well i think that's all ready possible i think that you can waive the right to a jury trial uh
uh it means that you've got to be informed and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision
yeah every every penny is earmarked but um it we have found that that works the best and
i mean i don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if you know six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal
well the people i know who've served have said that usually what ends up happening
and in many cases looking at what had happened at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right went back to the jurors uh based on the deliberations some of them did say that you know when they were the only one left opposing
knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury
uh without thinking that there were people in who think each other areas area of of specialty and
if you were deeply involved in it then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know that much
and and and i think that you know i've had a regimen now for about you know ten fifteen years of of doing that
i mean we used to pay pay fifty cents an hour to babysit but mine mine are twenty two twenty three and twenty seven so you know that i guess babysitters now are up at what five dollars an hour
you know it's basically since the end of there was always you know that little proxy war going on
the cynical side of me says that you know who it was more for
um-hum so you think that i mean that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry
i think i think that there'd that there'd be a large variation in
um-hum well i think i think that you know that's pretty typical of the of the entire entire involvement over in that you know that nothing was really addressed it wasn't it wasn't you know it was never we we announced that we were going to war it was it was such a gradual
yeah and i really think that you know in the in the involvement that
i've never actually seen her in concert i imagine that she puts on a pretty good show
but i'm um i think eventually i'll start using it for spread sheets and things like that um what do you find that you use yours mostly for
is all and there's i remember that there was one game that i played that required forty eight and there was only one computer that had forty eight on it at the time
you know i know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the
yeah the other the other thing that that we've found that that helps if
that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize there's absolutely or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it
well i i think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands and you know then then maybe those other people would be kind of scared and they would not do these bad things you know
that is definitely the most important um pension i guess is next um thank that i had one
but uh actually i do think that the parents should have you know a little bit more time to spend with their kids
you know that's what i mean cause i am from
there you can tell that it's getting worse i mean it it definitely it's not at a level comparable to or but you can
well it depends on whether you whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive aggression oriented military
and uh we live from hand to mouth we hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not then we try to due for the next month
and she's still alert enough that i think she would really know that we were putting her there and i think she'd really resent it
i think it's generally that switch over and i and i think that switch over has been more in the work force i don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force
i mean if you look at the the high unemployment rate right now and you look at people who are in those situations i don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them even ideas of how to make those changes now
but i just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job
you know i think that uh i mean i know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education and uh
but i do i do think that um i mean public education in general i think can work and i think it's a good thing
and uh the baby just screams i mean the baby is like seventeen months and she just screams we even she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there they're not even there yet
and they were calling me and they says somebody's got to pick him up and i kept thinking that she was gonna get picked up
and i think that's it it's one thing voluntarily give it because someone asks you can always refuse but it's another thing where it's required by law and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody
i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on
um i will read our current letters that come out on elections and i guess i do read that and i do study who's running in our area and i do study what's going on in the economy
well i um they even did a story on our news here in on what people wanted to see more of and people said that they wanted to see more on
i know that i have three children and um i stay home i don't work
um we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money um instead of just writing checks for things
everything's taken care of and we're finding that we even have more money than we thought
it really works out great we're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that and we're
i think that a jury should listen to the court
right and i don't know all the details on that but i certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the
and i just thought that they done broke up and
let's get how see how much money we can get out of her you know that's what happens every time um so
well i uh i know that since i do work i buy a lot of quicker
but more than that i don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children
i think that you know a person's competence should be more determined by
no i i can't say that i have either
once once it seemed i got into high school they had a lot of uh accelerated accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that and that mean that that makes a big difference because uh when you're when you're taking classes with uh
the only thing i know that you can recycle is milk jugs
i don't i don't know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial they get too boring
i mean we all know that that's not necessarily true but i i think that there are there are advantages to having seniority and uh
yeah i don't blame it on the teachers in the school i although i think that i do know for a fact that some of the teachers that i know personally get paid an awful lot more than
i think that murder itself would decrease significantly if if there was a credible punishment
those individuals i think that you you end up with a uh
my tax bracket is is pretty high up there i pay the i generally pay the maximum tax bracket and uh i think that we're paying too much because i don't have any children
then i don't argue with it because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh i bought this out of state i need to the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to
and i know that there are a lot of foreigners uh here you you know doing my line of work
uh well yeah i know it's it's a lot you know that uh that i feel like you know just like you said that it there's just so much that you can do yourself
now how do you mean that i know it
the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them
and you know they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this but they're really looking for someone who will
well i like the idea of voluntary voluntary support i mean they might be able to ah say that anyone who does that uh gets certain benefits that would not be available to someone who didn't do it
but to use force um really sets us a a it it essentially says that your body there's a title to your body and that title belongs to the government and you are not a free citizen
all right that's better yeah no there they they figure that they can draft you at eighteen age they usually do draft you at nineteen and that's the age they're looking at
uh you know they're not going to do their job which is the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there's enough
well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis
but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk i don't know they say that system seven uses a lot of memory
um-hum so they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers but
oh i agree with you but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of of discrimination or or
i've found that i've had a lot of luck with them uh course i'm a mechanically inclined kind of person and i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that
right i think that i i think that that i agree with you certainly in the second
yeah i'm surprised to hear that the are coming back uh they've got some pretty powerful
yeah i think that we're gonna be uh owning a mini van for some years to come probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway
because i mean i do think that some people need them and like for protection and stuff and i can understand them wanting to have them but then again it's just like all those nutcases out there
no i don't think that there's enough being done now i work at at their corporate headquarters and we have a paper recycling
but the yeah i think the i think the health insurance i think that's that's going through changes everywhere to uh the they've uh uh
i think i'm more worried about the deficit the national deficit than than uh a lot of other people are and think that we need to we need to
i wouldn't think that it does
didn't turn out the as the way i planned it i mean the way that i would think that it would go it
uh i don't think that they they they educate them enough to
and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that you know that there are problems and you know
a few months ago that they had six member juries i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak
well uh i don't know that we really have a budget i have a set amount that i that i save actually well actually there is a a way uh we budget our our money apparently uh
well i found that uh you know things as as i've gotten older i'm in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to very have a very strict budget i had four kids and uh
but they said they've skied and it sounded like you know that they skied really well and when they are actually talking about a place it was kind of funny
can i don't know whether i'm supposed to ask questions about i'm not supposed to ask questions about this whole procedure i know that i guess i well when i
yeah and then i was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody than than it does to keep them
i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes
um-hum i don't i don't know that there is an easy solution but
the uh i i have to say that let's see at this point on i don't run out of money um and it uh
those types of things and i found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in uh
uh i've been real impressed with that you you and i didn't realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now
have to agree with you and i'm kind of in in favor of capital punishment also i just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes but
yeah so i got it right out of college and so it's uh it's starting to show that wear and tear now
yeah yeah i did too i remember used i used to work at uh and uh and i just couldn't believe um you know that now i would hate to work at a fast food restaurant or even have my children work in one
you know and i thought that uh you know we'd have to have a big dog but we don't need a big dog we got this little bitty dog that uh part and part uh and he um he's very protective
and you know that i'm need to do this that and the other and uh so i try to do combinations of things but not like go down to the like i see all these people do
but you know i don't think that that would stop people i mean it's like they they see that word and it says uh go
but uh no i find that i use the the personal computer a lot though for my and um also for my spread sheets um so i think it's extremely helpful and very useful
uh i think that i think that's the way things work in and i know they work that way in uh say here in
um i think that it i think it has to do with uh
well that's that's a really hard question i do know that uh politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths um
absolutely prohibit it some states um say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that our state doesn't yet
well you know that's kind of interesting though because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore i use to think that you know after you worth
do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit if you would fund that somewhat
well i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh and i can uh relate to that uh
i think that we are going to be uh on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term
and if we men and women would do as the said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves can you picture that
for the issues that you know that i felt really strong for um
so uh yeah uh it was really funny you know that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and and how to uh keep uh
i know that there are many countries that um
well i would i would think that they would have that as part part of the benefit
too serious a problem but i don't know if it was from the the the late freezes that were or the early freezes we had that caused this tree damage and you know said you know that's what happened to the
um-hum well do you think that uh we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and uh
you know so uh the only thing we're you know that we do now is uh i keep a a little spreadsheet of uh what i call the net worth calculation which is just the
oh but those are my personal thoughts and i think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run we'd have got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people
well i decided that you know you need that once in awhile that you you need to plan the quality time and and i do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty four hours a day
um i don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans uh i think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles things like that
well uh it's frustrating to me because i really wish that i did have more
i think about young people that think you know there's kind of that feeling of hey it's so neat i have my first credit card and and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments you know
you know i mean you know any any country that wants to be democratic i'm all for helping them you know because i i understand that you know you're looking at as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government
and i drove a nineteen seventy seven um and so i believe and i'll know the answer today that they're going to total it i think that it will cost more to fix it than it's probably worth
did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder
and uh it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them you know she loved them like they were hers and i knew you know i had good peace of mind i knew that they were taken care of and
uh but i know that that's causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like geez you you told us to stand up against him but you're not helping and so i think he's in a pretty awkward position now and i i i think we ought to help
yeah and i i think that we learned from that and i think it it's one of those things that you learn the hard way it was a tragic mistake the way that they have been treated over the years and i believe that's just now
do you think that the individual has as much time as they did let's say ten twenty years ago
i think that that you know i don't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot
right yeah i'm i need to get i'm i'm i'm pretty bad about that i'm lazy i should i know i want i always say that i need to get running start running and i going to try and do that this summer
i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns
yeah i saw that one see that was a rerun
well that i i guess that's what i need to do is is get some kind of lessons or something because i my my tee off is not bad i mean i'm i'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that it's just that that initial tee
i had said that they they said it had to be like a first time buyer's car or whatever and
nice talking to you i'll probably talk to you again i had a friend who was in this and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes yeah
but i it's taken me a long time to understand that uh lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of
you know amateur as novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice
and the kids see that and uh they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where uh you know running for uh drug dealers if
um i didn't think that you really had to have a a jury
didn't realize that we didn't have any uh turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house so i had it had it all over my hands at first i didn't realize you know i had never painted anything so i didn't realize that i needed that i mean i kind of knew in the back of my mind
i'm not saying that i do either but you know it's just funny and and we really don't have any they don't have social security and everything really isn't that much for
yeah i mean i'm sure there's some good ones but i just i don't think that i would hum
but it's funny that you'd say that because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all so it's kind of like they were
gone the rounds so i think think that maybe that's effected it to some degree they say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit so i
yes and uh i was kind of mad mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or
real worries because you know that they'll play with whoever's there and they usually adapt pretty well
i think that uh you know that there needs to be a way that you know once someone
you know that that happened and that these people you know in the in the course of the trial you know came up with with all these you know things about well you know they were disadvantaged and all this stuff well nobody's that disadvantaged
um or at least i didn't think so but my mother worked and i kind of now wish that that she hadn't that uh
that that might be a better way to do it and then people would would know that it was gonna cost them money to not sort their trash
yeah i don't know i think that uh i know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked however
they don't think that they can get any information out of the manual some manuals aren't really designed very well
they know that i had done it in the colors that they had decorated the uh
well you know in a situation like that i don't know if that's good or bad i do know that i've had tenured professors that were just sorry
uh right now i'm just sewing for myself i i do have two daughters that you know out they're they're grown now though i wish that i had started sewing you know when they were younger
and then the there's a seam stitch and it's the loopers that form the the edge you know that edge finish
and i hadn't read the uh terms of the credit agreement really and uh when i did i you know i realized that that it just looked seemed like i was never paying the balance
right because clothes are some are really expensive you know uh uh a little simple shell shell blouse you know that you can make for about
all right i wonder if if they didn't make it mandatory if they would actually get enough people volunteering to to to do it that it you know that they would have enough
with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment
and they took us out on the lake several times and uh i really did enjoy that i don't know that i ever learned to drive it or anything but um we did some water skiing of course and and uh
i i do my share of it i i certainly can't say that i understand a lot of it
our political people would really go there and look out for our interests i think that's what upsets me worse than that they're getting a little you know uh on the side that
i don't think that they anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government
it is so much fun to see these players you see on to and to hear that ball go whizzing by
and it seems even though you know that they got the prisoner himself can come to the point that hey i'm tired i just want out
i don't know that i'll go with i've bought a new car the last three that i've bought and i don't know that i'll buy a brand new one again
and i find that i'm enjoying this one far more than i ever did when it was the children's dog
they said that we could share we share a recipe but i'm up at my daughter's i don't even have any of my recipes with me uh you know
i think if somebody's not on drugs they have no reason you know to be afraid of it uh i do think that there has to be some controls uh like i don't think one test positive should
i don't know that you i know i always overeat no matter i go with good intentions
but i understand that we have an aunt that lives out there and when she was visiting here she would look up at the stars and and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw
that it's and they don't realize that these things are going to affect everybody and if if you're older and it's not going to affect you that way you have grandchildren you have children uh nieces nephews whatever friends
and it's just hard to think that they could allow
part of it is that uh i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis and i think that if we're doing other things and these programs come in
i i realize that innocent people could go to uh what is it lethal injection now
right and i realize that that is designed to protect the innocent it's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers and uh i
i just don't think that i think we could get along a lot better in our criminal justice system if we had some statute of limitations on lawyers i hope you're not a lawyer
our justice system is is the best around but it's not perfect and that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact
you know that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now
and uh it i think that's what happens when they get scattered the the family unit
i realize that he'd like his career to develop but i don't want to see him in other things
they really do and uh i really do not think that we did those young men right i think that uh shows a lot of learning since that time
oh mine had a very short fuse if he did something bad he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it he's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls i mean just get so mad he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal
i like to instead of thinking how much you know that i'm paying out i like to just look at it and say oh well everyone else is doing it too you know
i think if uh i would have went with the math i think i would have done a lot better because i was more interested and that's what i i knew that's what i wanted
and i know that um i've covered for people that came in drunk you know on the late shift or something
oh because i know a little bit about music you know so i thought that i would put that plus i
well the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous i mean if one is determined that it's you know that he feels that he's you know going against the other eleven they all stay until everyone agrees
but see um when i was younger i used to say that i would like to have five well i've even cut that down now and um
well i i'm i'm from and i can't say that there's too much of that there um
uh no i can't say that i just know that it's really bad in some areas and something's going to have to be done sooner but
you know like for for the men that don't have jobs if you know she feels that if those women weren't out there just because they want to do it she said that you know they could stay at home and with yeah
but i can't say that there's really that many people that like sit in front of the all day
well you said that you had a garden what what all things do you plant in it or do you like to plant in it
no i don't i don't think they do i don't think how i don't think how they could find that big you know how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some and still open
yes and it was it was awful to hear what you know what some of these people really went through i forget the percentage of people that you know that she had said and this was i mean she did research on it and everything
i would say that you know for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated it would be kind of hard for you know
uh i'm not sure about whether we have it or not for some reason i was thinking that we do but it's you know it's not very often i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that
i think that you know it was something like that and it surprised and even i know they have it and you don't really hear about it real often how many people
so i don't think that they deserve anything less
you know i know so very few people who have extended family in town i'm real jealous when i hear that somebody has a grandma around because we don't and
actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not uh if you're catching your grass clippings that that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn it's amazing
right and that will come i know that day will come and i am looking forward to that too but that's a different phase in my life and i am i am glad that i am able to do what i want to do right now
yeah definitely i think that there's probably a lot of
well that's right the i think that oh politicians talk a lot about waste but i'm not sure that that's really that much of the
well i agree that it's a big task but i think that i think that the should move towards some kind of national health care plan
i do too and and you know but the way the courts are set up they've they've got so many chances for appeal but i think that i think it needs to be expedited you know if they've been convicted and given them appeal
boy haven't that we though we really have but anyway i'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the capital punishment i'm i'm very for it always have been always will be
with you know with that guy from getting all that money twenty seven or twenty nine million or whatever it was i just don't think that they're gonna be able to sign and it's just gonna be a shame for you know our area
and this is huge you know of course when he runs around the yard he just digs he doesn't know that he's tearing up things but he does
that's what that's what it said that it said there was always a line but that's probably i mean that's a good that's a good sign
and they have these really corny radio commercials but their steak their steak is supposed to be wonderful so i had i had not tried that my husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie
yeah bugs is what i'd heard them called so anyhow occasionally i find them in the flower beds they said that every yard has some but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem
well i understand that too i understand that too now they had
and we uh took we subscribe to and we took that and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during any kind of thing like the earthquake and i have gotten stuck on a lot of this the news shows and the stuff that comes on that
oh we have not seen that we want to see that one
well i know our son and live in and i know they have commented on the system i don't know that they know that it worked that way but they have the two separate containers and stuff
if they knew that i came in there at all different hours
um-hum did she know that she was going to a nursing home did she know that she was going to a nursing home
but um you know i do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just had her have her spayed you know
and i imagine that you have found that the homes uh here are uh a much better value down here aren't they than there
okay the topic of the conversation is national health insurance and the pros and cons and do i do we think that the government should finance it what is your opinion
i know that it's getting to the point that the insurance doesn't pay that much on catastrophic illnesses
well i know they have the you know for those that have trouble and i know that like we have the uh prescription cards which that's helped bunches
you know i'm not that familiar i just know that you know there at was just a great program
uh in the war they would bring it down to a child's level in words you know that they could understand what was going on and uh
i noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that the oldest one he's nine and uh he would particularly enjoy this been a couple of years ago and uh
well do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to
you know that they they now have a uh i believe it's a federal law that you do not have to give
from from some list you know that knows that i have a say a charge account at at or something because then i'll get
i'd i know that i had taken care of my grandchildren recently while my daughter and her husband had been out of town
yeah my husband and i he he says his idea now of roughing it is the and i agree with him our children are are grown but i know that we liked it when our kids were teenagers because we got away from the
yes like i know that you know breakfast we would you know we'd have these big breakfast cooked over this little stove and
yeah i can i can understand that i was raised in and course being and uh
fast food oh i can understand that i can remember when our children were small we lived in the area at the time and we had a lot of when they were first coming out i can't look a in the face now
i know that we have you know really in fact they're they're releasing people
and um you know so we're having problems in in that way and i know that there are some cases that uh
people are brought up over here thinking that you know everybody owes them something
i think it is and my family said that in there was just an article on at the news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule
uh i don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards but often juries hear only a fraction of the of the story
and it's it's good for kids to know that they have other family
in fact i think that it it affected the the sentence though capital punishment is available the sentence of life without possibility of parole uh has become a common one
so that was the thing that i noticed that i know a lot of the people lot of friends that we have they have a tendency to do the same thing and one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible
because i've heard that you know you get locked into routines and you're gonna hit this up point where you just stop developing
so i think there's a lot of people that have you know really i guess that you'd call it really sport fishing they're really into it to try to win
i think that once you do that your children kind of develop the same attitudes at least my daughters have they try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up
i imagine that they have uh some a lot of homework too
well from your point of view how would you feel about actually sending someone that that's you know means something to you to one of those homes i realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it and of course that makes sense but
are you just saying that you sight read every concert
when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to to come in and uh ask for your support
oh and my kids both saw that they liked it
i know that one sounded gross i know my husband wouldn't have stood for that he means he likes and things yeah
but i do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five six grades and just keep going going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write
oh i see oh i didn't really know that i know a lot of their
well i don't understand economics that well i don't know i i know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't
are things that i think about a lot um i think that and i think that involves
that's really sad i think that a lot of people and they think they have to but i i think that if they really tried they wouldn't have to and i i think that if they didn't that
no no i didn't think that anybody had those at all yet
they don't even know that paper comes from trees yet so
yeah that's what i said that's what i told the guy the guy was standing there and he laughed when it fell off and i said that's a quick release right there
you know that that try to sell you the newspaper and uh what carpet cleaning and uh
and they ask that you know they start out and they ask you even even to your income level i think that's you know
baseball that's true i i would say that baseball tends to be one of the less
more drug problems and typical uh small city type problems but i don't know that there's a real
the disparity of excuse me and in he'd think that it would have to have been
yeah well i not to toot my own horn here or anything but i was graduated from my high school i was the valedictorian and i know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me
i think that you know i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is and so hopefully they'll do it soon that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week
but um i know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around those you know they wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera
oh it's terrible well i mean it makes you understand that you know things are different you know we might right we might decide what's proper and what isn't but you know that's the way it is for them
that sounds fun i find a lot of the cookbooks that i don't know that you buy over the counter
um i just got it about eight six months ago and i find that it it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get
um well see it's more of my grandma that feels that way she says that when her husband died that he said
so that's nice so you always get two days at a lot of people just take you know that week i normally take that week somehow you know
but afterwards uh maybe if you had a controlled substance well you you probably put down you know you had or if you would remember that you did it
no i'm just saying you probably probably put down on the sheet anything you have taken but if they had a controlled substance maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name
and uh you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom all of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items
didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them but there was quite a few lakes all around there it seemed like it was almost like you were living on an island there was so much water around where i was
we had uh another person coming from our outside counsel and she was told that we were gonna be in a warehouse but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse
i don't know that i want to sit on a jury like that and you'd still you know i want ask some questions
then some like your pay what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that you know will cover all of the expenses
and so it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise in my job at i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so
so they knew that there was something going on here so they started looking into programs
one of the nice things but uh yeah i i i don't think that there's anything as original it's it's all based on uh one of the past styles they just uh
i think that's what made us uh progress to the state we are is our curiosity
i think that i think it would be fair i think if if the company could not provide it all on their own for the for the people that would be using it you know a a a certain amount of their salary would go to it but it would still probably be cheaper
i think they do as a matter of fact one of the uh commentators said that they expected that the would uh if they continued at their current pace uh set an record for seventy wins in a season
yeah i mean that's i think the way it uh i think that's the way it works now in basketball you you know was a franchise for the and you know uh for the for the uh and
and i also sort of worry that you know that sometimes people give away personal information um
you know well back back to this visiting thing i mean i found that my kids had no conception of what college was really like um and and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand
you know there's pros and cons on both side of that because if they were then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing or some kind of something to be okay okay get an okay seal
so um that's always helpful and i know that we have we have the the can
and so i think that we're going to try that i i think the
yeah and i also think that in the future that uh it's gonna continue that we're not gonna see a lax off of women in the work force i think they're going to stay there and i think that they're gonna
well i think that's all i have to say okay have a good night all right bye-bye
i think that sometimes the things they show on there though uh the problems that their kids get into are are good to uh show that they do have problems anyway
and no i think that uh you know a a waiting period uh can make a difference but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that
yeah someone told me that that it that they had done it both ways and i've always after hearing that i always sewed it on even
i do not know what what the answer is but i do know that there are some wonderful places out there and
and i guess i see both sides in that at the at the same time that i'm saying that you know we're committing the same crime
see and i don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces it's i mean i don't know that i have that much concrete knowledge in the current measuring system that would prevent me from
i'm getting better about this knowing that i need exercise and doing it but it's still at the task stage
right well i think she kept saying that uh they talked about her it it was a film of her concert
and uh you know well i had my baby with me and i found that all i talked about was my baby which was fine with me but it's like you know here these people are they're going to school getting degrees making all this money and you know they kind of looked at me like i was
but i've really noticed that there are a lot of uh a lot more people that are more comfortable at least with some women being home and
um-hum he just thought that they belong and when he'd she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that
there's almost too much of a choice anymore you know that there's
and so every days are different and i think that you know i think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older and
yeah because people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay i have had months where i was shocked at how much had come in because like i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process
well anyway i just think that you know the policy over there i think we should just leave them alone i really do in in a major way because they just um
well i think that well part i think that's partially true i think you have to have the will and the and the um
i'll just start by saying that we entertain with uh a gourmet club here
um which means that we have like eight eight people four couples
so he had to redo them like three times before i was happy with them before he was happy you know that they even looked halfway decent and
to continue in that vein i think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas but i really do think that women have made a contribution
it's dangerous for the woman too to think that she can do that and then when she can't you know the failure of that is
well i think that society has come to a point where they're they're not responsible for any of their actions somebody else uh made them do it uh
managed scarcity and they said that in there were as many
you know that i read in or somewhere no it was
and they just i've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words uh usually uh just
uh you know i i didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that i thought we came in as as first advisors to the the and then they decided to pull out and
um no i had thought that they had uh colonies there or something
let's see i think that gun control has come up because there's been some crazies that killed people with guns
i think that i should have a right to own a handgun not a automatic semiautomatic
well is a nasty terrible disease and you die from it so i think that uh they need to look into it and it's kind of like cancer i don't you know how
um i would imagine that we've talked the amount of time necessary
oh it's wonderful place to live and they i don't have any kids so i don't really know but they say that we have wonderful schools
you know that's i guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code
and i've always said that if i had a kid they wouldn't know what is
yeah i guess that's what first drew us to him the uh
and i think that's the only reason i have a problem with it when there's no you know there's no reason to suspect someone you know that that's getting a little bit that's enough to make anybody paranoid
to protest saying that it invaded their i guess first amendment the the search and seizure amendment
yeah i've got i've got two that i you know that usually i'll have a a balance on
now we got that's that's funny you said that because we got a credit card um my husband and i got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for
i think that card has a good idea with you know giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you you purchase as long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back
you know that i had talked to about certain programs say that you know they had read other things besides what presented
do you think that what they say that they are interested in is eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at
my parents didn't even discuss with me going to college out of state or anyplace else and i just knew that the finances you know would not support it if i had known
now my kids i keep saying that uh you know i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could
boy i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that you know and it's not applicable to me and i was kind of horrified
but i guess things have gotten better i've been told that there's flex hour and those kind of things
i mean i think i've read all four of them and i understand that there's a fifth in the last six weeks he's been on the road a lot
well you see i think that that just harks right back to the elementary and junior high years because i have a stepson now who's twenty five and uh i was just absolutely shocked
well i i'm not really certain how i uh i i'm not certain that it does does a lot of good i mean that it ends up ends up effectively uh uh
and so we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day
cold cuts and i i bought turkey and pastrami and and barbecued ham at a an market near here and i've never been there before and i found that there's uh individual vendors and the foods are wonderful and one of the uh the um vendors had
i thought i thought that there was a slight difference in accent
uh that's actually on land i believe but um it has uh been ruled against uh regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the
force uh government uh that we elect to deal more seriously with it and i do think that we have a responsibility there i must admit i'm not always real politically active but i do think that
governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't
so but i do not know that i have seen any of the uh sequels to that
but he is still alive and that you know that's what makes it so interesting
fairly regularly thinking that you know he he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not
the person said that they hadn't used anything and their test came back positive and normally we didn't retest them but there were a couple people that we really thought that they were telling the truth and we retested them like the next day and they came back negative
yeah i know that they are lowering the age of uh
i thought that they all had to agree or else they it was a hung jury
i wish that when they sentence someone if they're going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years
and i wish that our recycling center took paper bags they won't take those
uh i tell my husband to sing to my stomach because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they're still in the womb and i said then when when it's born you can hold it and sing that again and maybe it'll comfort her you know when she's fussy and stuff
yeah i think i think that's a lot of people just indifferent i know that i've moved around a lot in the past um three years i've had three different addresses each time i change jurisdictions or whatever
well you know they also say that most people vote their local politics that that local is far much more important than uh national issues
and i know that they're expecting a gigantic turn out to landslide into as into the senate
my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible she's like openly told people she's always been very good about knowing yes she's eighty nine and she said that she really would like to stay in her house as long as possible because it's her home
and i guess that's what i hope for them but some of them don't want those freedoms i think their their religious beliefs may um
and i guess that's all gone i think that's really uh probably what started the whole process i
uh the the market i guess the the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it that make sense he's one of the big proponents of that he gets on national television and and says that you know so it's um
and even then you know we're really running out of space so i think that that became that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space in some of the more crowded states
and while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background you know that they wanted something and they were arguing back and forth and she just kept talking the whole time it was pretty funny
almost everywhere and you know you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a which means that you know whole week's worth of courses so that lets you be available three days during the week
well a lot of the research shows that like while was playing at basketball
the well the event he was trying to swim they even the research shows that distance running
unless the burning unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know but i i think that's i guess that's i think that's my opinion yeah i guess you feel differently
uh i think that's what's made democracy
i really didn't notice at all it just seemed the same but when i went more rural you know that it really changed so
well i just think that uh you know at that time when when they were you know those were all brothers and sisters a lot and
too many the problem with with right now is that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through and and i think that i think you you mentioned i think that they have a system where uh
uh uh an education it shows i think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know and that may be
you know there uh i used to could be able to name ten shows or so you know that i felt were worth my time to watch but uh i
um my husband takes that and i'll help rake up the grass and um sometimes i'll help him edge um because we don't have that much property but we're on a corner lot so there's a lot of edging to do and um
um yeah i agree i also think that there are more um the people are women stay single longer it seems like
oh it just seems like there are more single mothers too i mean that's there're a lot of
um-hum it's really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that i try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where i know that the bill's going to come but sometimes i forget and
i guess that means you're going to get a double long summer
see now and i'm not into crafts so so you know that that eliminates like three quarters of the magazine you know well
my daughter thinks that anytime she sees newspapers bundled up they're being recycled so it's like well no honey so that like so that was one reason we went to show her
a lot of car manufacturers don't really keep that into consideration don't take that into consideration you know
my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that i'd go now now which one could that be you know and i'd i'd start trying to focus in on people instead of
and it's just incredible to think that there's uh there are players
uh i was crazy so my family may say that on occasion who knows you know uh i don't think it's that hard to do
but uh i don't know i can say that i think my my favorite spots are still to go to go where there's mountains and and lot of trees and and wildlife to view and and uh
well like i said the risque stuff just i guess they think that's what people want to watch
um you know do you ever do you ever see problems you know that you feel you know that the kids are are left alone too much and
it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control
i thought that if i had a good hunting dog like that boy i could just go out and get all kinds of game yeah except we live in now so
but uh it's really scary to know that you you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe and
and i feel guilty that i haven't done that here haven't taken the time and i know that you know people can make a difference but it's hard to
and everything and i hope that i will become
and i don't know that you know i don't being so young i don't remember why
well do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison
fought for in other countries you know that they have corruption and and they don't have um
going into the air and and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there and everywhere it all adds up
well have you ever visited um like or any place that's ever it's kind of known that it has uh pollution in it's air
we're really enjoying it i wonder what it would be like i mean i i wanted to be close to family but i also thought that it would be harder to be close to family but it's turned out really good and i think that you know we're really satisfied with that choice and
three hundred dollars and then he thinks that he has the money that that he can spend on something and he hasn't given it to someone else so he gets some satisfaction out of that although
but i know from his childhood he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment i guess and um so growing up he
kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and and things like that and i think that it would help people to become less self-centered and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to um
uh because of a service that they could provide you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to be rich
i think that's what we have to have to you know have our streets and and have our government and excuse me and have
because um you know that we've had enough industry here that i guess it is that why we don't the industry here is able to to um fund
i just don't think you know that there was that big problem
and i don't i didn't watch them but i couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it the whole ceiling you know just within a couple of hours
well i like the classics too uh i think that there's a lot of
it's a lot of trouble to to take care of that and of course the kids say then why bother just let me wear what i want and and yet we can't to that either i'd like to see them go to to not necessarily a uniform but saying that they've got to wear
i would i would rather have it that way to know that i was chosen
at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in
i think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything and of course the big deal one of the big deals now too is to that when you
cafe a cafe so it's not really anything you know that i wanna
yeah i i've i've i've found that too you know where the wife is married and
at least that was you know that's what everybody says oh yeah yeah we want only to have them
i've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it
and i and i think that i don't i mean to you but you know
and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint
well i understand that you know
and i don't think that i saw it in him until maybe last year uh
and then her little brother's only two years behind and he says well i don't know i think that i probably want to be a veterinarian and i said that's great let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that
up in style home i should i would hate to think that anybody thought i
oh that's it see and that's even with my gas card you know i find that i'll go in to get some gas and i'll end up buying you know
i liked it almost as well uh but uh you know that i'm not going to hold them to that just because i went there i you know think that's they want to that's fine but
but you know i think i think that's most of it personally but that's why i you know with my kids i think that you know i am just going to encourage them to go and i am going to try to help them financially but i think you know
you know always used to be so you know just so honest and pure i guess and when he left the show you know that it seemed to be missing that part of it and i never did like it after that
uh it's kind of risque stuff for maybe for teenagers you know or and and you can kind of relate to it you know i don't know that's i enjoy that a lot
you know the the other thought that i had um i've had several minutes to think about this after i uh while i was finding people i uh
yeah i it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that you know it's coming in a couple of months but
i don't know it's just hard to hard to take um you know see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use
well i i do wish that it would stop on my end because it it seems to happen at the worst possible moments
you know but even even through those groups groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to
and uh it it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded because they're thinking that their water is going to be contaminated somehow and so they
and i would like to know that there are
that that's what would just really kill me i'd like to know that you know they have friends there and they you know have little conversations and things i'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and
uh-huh i didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that that's really neat that's really neat
that is great for that that will be something you know they would look forward to if they knew that you know that the puppy is coming on
yeah for me i think that drug testing just it it follows the path that society's going in if more and more people are using drugs then i think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs
you know don't have anything to hide and then there are some things that just aren't people's business you know that they come out at that point so i think a lot of people have trouble with that
i don't think that some thing i mean there are some people
just simply because that time isn't spent just doing things like fishing and because that i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot and the communication helps you build on your uh
and you brought up a good point you know about learning you just don't want a babysitter you you would hope that maybe they'd come home and know some of their or something you know get them
uh-huh um i think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system as far as uh people dropping out of school uh
of of the different cultures there not that it not that it's better but i'm just saying that i think that big
i don't well just because i'm i'm thinking that it it's getting so short on radio just you
she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in she wouldn't want to know you know that they're bombing or or this and that's going on
i think that uh you know you can just look at home life and see i've been talking a lot of people about education and things and and what what what affects the school system and i think that a big thing that affects it is that the mother is not home anymore
you know go out and do what they want to do but i think that um society's going to really have to get used to it and they're not quite used to it yet and that's i
i think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they
and that's all they know and i'm thinking that community service would help them uh just get a feel of what else is out there how other people are living you know if they were to work in in uh uh
um-hum and i think that that you know this on the same note
yeah i've heard that's we uh rented the other one i was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately was um with uh
i you know i think it's kind of coming back around to that don't you i mean that there's a lot more people that stay home now than before but
i don't i don't think that you can have i mean there's no way i could have a career and then be the kind of mom that i wanna be
well i know that um we have some relatives that live um like around the area in there i know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there
and and like um they also take some things at um the dump behind the fire station there and i know that they're gonna use you know the money for that to build some kind of um
well it was nice talking to you i know that they've started over in where my dad lives they pick up newspapers i think no so yeah
well yeah i agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get and i think that you know i don't think there's probably any really
i don't i don't know that you could require everyone to to do that for yeah to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that i don't know that that would work if if somebody's
oh really well i know that i learned how to knit one time and um
i don't know i've only done this one other time and i thought that the man told me five minutes so
we're usually outside and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows shows that if we get them in bed we usually watch that and is one of my favorites
well yeah and you know they especially boys i mean they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff and i don't think that they really realize that death is forever you know
yeah yeah it's i you know and i think you're right though i think that it has to really hit home before the message sometimes or you have to grow up with it being important important in your life um oh oh um before the message really takes hold sometimes and
may be country it might be classical it might be uh rock you know it was just he said that that just about what you said that he just liked all kinds of music and
i know that there are if you're interested in choral singing i'm not sure where you are in but i do know that some communities have uh
there usually you know that they take tours and things like that and you get to know you know people um socially as well as as in a musical setting so that's always fun i think that's
i have heard about that but i've never tried it no um um well i should say i have heard of one that has vinegar in it i don't know that it has egg in it uh-huh uh-huh do you have it right on the top of your head
in recent years it's just really really changed a lot and and i think that uh you know the one thing that i have seen is that more and more women are getting into management but i think they've got a long way to go
of the board are women in this country and and i thought that you know that's pretty significantly a pretty significantly small number so there are some some strides to be made there
uh because i would think i think you know mentally um and emotionally i think that women can handle a job and every bit as well so anyway it's it'll be interesting to see where it all goes
like me and whether or not uh uh uh not i think that we're paying too much taxes um that including taxes in general or income tax
yeah i kind of wonder what what kind of tradition we're going to establish for our family you know i had hoped that our our kids get together uh at least regularly
and we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem uh even a more major problem uh in some of the major problems um
i wish that there were a way that you could um get your telephone you know submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty
yeah so he knew the feeling because my other son is at which is fifteen hundred and he had visited his brother at and knew that he liked the environment but he did go on college visits and he liked
uh he had to really decide what he wanted out of college he had to look at himself uh in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it he could probably slip
yeah i guess kids do mature at different ages too that's and you know as a teacher you you try to make be understanding that you know there are different ages kids are is
granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it but it when they when it's not there they miss it
i had the ceiling fan put up and it the bird got away from him one afternoon and i mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall i thought oh so much for the bird no he's still alive and kicking
seems to me i remember that uh i was hired came in and went through some orientation and i thought i
well i don't know um there's there's a part of me that says that you know i'm i'm sort of glad went away
right and i and i understand that and i say hey if the guy can't play you don't blame the team that uh hit it to him you blame the team you know for putting him in
yeah that'll be nice i mean that that i think tends to just keep i think stadiums have worked tend to keep people happy
the which is the uh farm team for the so everybody hopes that uh they go all the way around here they're the they're the big team in
okay um do you think that the represents a threat to us
yeah actually i noticed that i mean this this this this most recent scam of his where he said
started off as an electrical electrical an electrical engineer student and then switched over at some point into language processing because he found that he enjoyed it more so they do force them people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here which i think is wonderful
yes agreed agreed well i'll i'll take that i'll take that and think that through a little bit um
so i don't know much about that i just know that um i wonder because sometimes i think about it actually i think well what if i were that one person and i was completely convinced that that that that this person wasn't guilty you know
they're one of the only countries in in in history that has been told that they have to give back what they took in a war which they didn't start
so i don't i don't know how to i don't i don't know what to do about it but um but i think that that you know in general the region is really in bad shape
yeah and i don't think that you killed your mother though i wouldn't worry about that
they feel like well you know the country's real important and you know if i elect if we help elect a president who's going to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know
now if things go the way that that that that they are there i think that they'll keep voting but i think they'll wind up like us at some point where people sort of
i think that so they want to you know try and i think they're trying i think that i think that most of the politicians understand this
and hope that it gets better
but uh you just took a roller and put it on there and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed so
and and jigs um they have like yellow um fuzz on a hook you know that kind of comes out
and if they are trying to hide something then i have to know that because we're talking we're talking
and uh other than that they you know leave you go about five minutes and then that that's about it i guess that's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat so
yeah and i can't say that i like a lot of the modern the very very modern
as far as other countries i'm not um i don't keep up on it too much just as far as what you know as what they're doing i know we were in last year and i know that the tax there is extremely high much higher than we pay here but
oh i didn't know that i thought whoever made the call could choose what topic because i haven't made any calls yet i've just received some
um i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at but i think our latest statistic statistic said something like ninety nine point
because of you know i think that they have they have it all over there in just a a few tiny two two miles you know there's mountains and there's beaches and it's all right there so
yeah i know my daughter saw that and she liked it so yeah
um-hum well i'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater
you know that that you grill out and i really don't particularly um
right i think that's what goes you know really goes right now in the in the area of course you know down
and um i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that can solve some of our
okay so you said that you live in
i know that um i do a lot of planning with our church and a lot of the times when we get together well everybody will bring a dish or and food is real big too
well i guess that i would like to to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or
right i think that you know i guess one time recently we went up to and had planned to camp
and so i would guess that you know there are quotas for different places
right i don't know that do cats bother bulbs i think more the mice or other rodents
that was that you know that that just continued to grow in fact after my group i mean we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread and then of course bowed out of that because that's uh uh
oh i was going to say that that sounds like like pretty many but i see what you meant you had them for each of the individual stores
two or so he would sit next to the desk where i was grading papers or writing lesson plans and he had asked for a paper and you know sort of scribble and then he realized that there were quiet times and there were active times
oh i uh i didn't know that somebody could avoid
and at least you know financially in the short run but i would think that they would get a much greater turnover and that people would be dissatisfied working for them
um i think that there are people that i think that uh i was a i was first generation going to college in my family
and i get into uh newspapers so that i guess that kind of tells you what kind of person i am i'm uh read read it fast and put it down
right uh well sometimes if you know if you're in transportation in public transportation i know that people'll read them on something like that
did you know that next week there's several shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary
uh so we are thinking that we might go to during the winter this year sometime for
it didn't happen in that manner before television and i i i i have to think that that it has some influence on it
and i i feel that the the only legitimate paper although it might sound a little elitist is the i've always read the when i was younger and i try to find now that it has a national edition i read that i also read uh
i find that i'm leaning on uh i travel a great deal uh even overseas and i find that i lean on uh quite a bit for concise and quick stuff and i'm
well yeah i uh was reporting direct from uh i think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him i think that what he he reported what he saw and if you didn't like it that was just too bad you know
well how do you feel about it i guess i i got to say if that's the subject if the subject is do i feel that we're well enough equipped to i don't know if if it said that i feel i'm well enough equipped
yeah i i can understand the public's alarm to it but i guess having done this all my life i knew that there wasn't a problem and and it indeed it has proved out that way but now try to get the damn thing repealed you know
and i think that there are there there are solutions certainly we don't even need a need a research anymore it's just a matter of passing the law and passing the law depends on how heavy the car industry the automobile lobby is
uh i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the military military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh i've found that you know there's an extraordinary amount of waste i take that as a
uh enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system because i guess everywhere i read that there's a shortage of judges
must have here is the the interviewing of jurors after the trial i mean that it seems to me that
it's kind of fun i mean i i i always say that i need to buy a computer for the house but i just haven't got around to doing it yet
yeah and then you don't stop to realize that you know you charge this for twenty charge that for twenty charge this for twenty and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars and you don't stop to think about it
okay they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars all the time so you know i think that it a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket someone that you know you can't really do it
but i don't have that experience so i can't say that you know he did well so
really i've heard different opinions about it uh uh-huh one that you know yeah it was too long and they thought that you know at certain points that it was going to end and it didn't and it kept going on and uh-huh
and you know i've called a couple of times but most of the time i notice that um you know it takes forever to get a call through
because uh you know that all depends too on where you are at that's uh sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are because the more grass root country uh parts of the country tend to
yeah well i'm just saying that that that's what the the client lawyers are saying they're saying that you know you know more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to
it has a name it basically means that it has a cheese cream sauce with it
yeah i think that's what's happening i think uh the judges
yeah well that uh that's something i i know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a predominately predominately predominately type area
uh but yeah i hope some of the local well that's what they they keep saying that it seems like people with it with
they just uh they just sent out a letter to everybody they does do business with saying that you know if you're interested we're doing a study and
yeah yeah well you know a little uh a little bit more than i do explain it said i didn't uh get to live through it that the people that i know that it did
and uh from and i haven't talked to any of them that that weren't you know glad that they went or or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one
that age of course everything you do they're trying to learn to do and so uh it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn you know that that they need to learn at the age you know
i don't know that that's where i think that most people get upset it's uh yeah it it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and uh
i find myself going to work knowing that that there's a job about half done at home and i really if i would if i'd just stay home and finish it i'd feel a lot better but uh
you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks but until it breaks you don't really know that there you were doing anything to it
that's that's the kind of things that uh you don't see in this country and that's that's why i think that you know it's it's i don't know if you can ever do enough but uh
yeah you know i kind of wish that they had interleague play like they do in all the other sports so i could see some of the teams here once in a while
uh-huh i think that it went up a thousand percent on most
but of course you're supposed to be the sun belt and i do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion
right yes i was going to say that it does make a difference when you're not accustomed
well but you know the the strange thing uh perhaps not strange but something that many people don't realize is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty one and fifty two and find that there were drug dealers
and uh not everyone votes at the same place uh i personally think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools to children from the little ones on up
right that's right and i think you know that's an excellent idea they for them to realize that that their going to have to do what someone else says even though they didn't vote for it
caring their parents say when i was your age i didn't have this or that and i know i never ever said that because i knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people
well that's the idea they figure that if they give you a card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it and
uh-huh well i think that there are many cases where uh the judges probably do make the decision rather than the jury situation was somewhat different
yeah and you there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place i don't think that they're gonna be serving anybody
and i think that they could get some results from that because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded but they don't know where to go to to to do anything
but uh that new stadium's going to be real nice and i heard that there's uh
i didn't uh see i never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie
that's true i agree with that um i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it i think it's been nominated for twelve awards and and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud so it it has surprised everybody
i think that i think he really his heart was in it but i don't i don't think he really knew it was gonna be as big as it was i think it was something that he really wanted to do
i think that i think he did a good job and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him
and uh you know they were told that you know during the trial that this is this guy's first offense and he's got this clean record and and they ended up the jury you know decided hey it's time to crackdown here you know and it's time to to do this drug thing and let's crackdown and let's really and they sentenced
that's very true yeah i was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day and i said you know i understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the
so that is kind of an idea that that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and said that they were looking into something like that so
oh i do too i do too the the on line um encyclopedia just sounds wonderful you know that that sounds like such a great idea you know it'd be nice to kind of fun to be to be able to play with it
so but you know i have found that with i have a two year old and i have found really though i'm kind of the opposite i'm more active now with him than i was before
and i'm kind of like you i wish they would do that because so at least i knew somebody you know was getting the money out of it you know that it was gonna use it for good so
i you know i don't know i think there's a point some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do it's just it just gets out of hand and i understand that you know that you know my husband and i
i don't know i guess that's you would consider that a home repair certainly uh
it was fairly expensive though i'm i was impressed i think that uh we we had somebody do it and and it was
advertisement advertisement and letting public letting you understand more of what it is you're doing why you're doing it how you're it's done and what what happens to it because i think that's that would help a lot
it wasn't it didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me they were
no there's so much more then that it starts very much deeper then that i think that too i see some flickers of
oh oh yeah i know that i had a cousin who lived in that's a that's a neat area but it's a that is a particularly neat area for camping
oh yeah definitely but i know that it's got to have a radio
to where i'm not quite as tired i guess but it's definitely a task i can't say that i really enjoy it i wish that i did enjoy it more but i do it because i have to not because i want to
i wish that i could make myself exercise every day but i do force myself to do it at least three times a week which i don't feel like is enough but
uh it's it's at least something you know it it i just force i have to force myself to do it like i said because to me i really don't enjoy it but i know that i have to do it i mean it's just
no i haven't seen anything uh but that doesn't mean that they don't i don't watch much but i haven't really seen anything advertised publicly
i think that it it really surprises me because of the cost savings i mean this is such a tremendous amount of cost savings i mean why
i can't understand why nobody saw that before i mean even even not
really i know i really i don't know i think that i mean i think that they really are doing a good thing now and i hope it keeps it well i'm sure it'll keep up
you know so i mean i don't know i think that if people are forced if the people are not forced to do it they may not you know i mean i don't know i think a lot of people still still still will but
you know that's what they did
and and i think that they're having a hard time with the concept of you cannot go back people only go forward
well uh i've had teenagers and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers and i don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective
i don't know that it does
but i knew that it was paid i knew
it wouldn't you know it wouldn't hit me in a big in a big way because i knew that uh i would have it covered in that respect
i would imagine i would imagine that if i change or if i get another car a new car i will go with the or something similar uh in that regard
i've heard that it's really against the well i mean that it's coming out with the idea that the not true
so i know that they have sold their mailing list
let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to uh to the office
that it that some of them are known that there is one that's out in this big lake and it's it's it's mosquitoes are terrible and then this uh there's this other one that's more up in the mountains but it surrounds a man-made reservoir
and uh my father had a small business and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business and he never did he always he did everything out by hand he only had three employees so
and i'm and i'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place
and um they said that they they have you have quite the problem with uh
because he had the few he knew what was going to happen more than any of us because i didn't realize that um it was going to make such a mess
you know it's it i guess you know you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together and you always wonder why they don't you know get together or whatever and so i guess that's what they decide to do
uh and you know that meant that they had to play a second half and they've not they've not had to do that all year and uh
well i didn't know that that's supposed to be a real good statistic uh
uh gigantic uh career years yet and and just kind of assume that you know someone one of them is going to break through eventually so and i i think they said the um this last year i'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years
uh you got me i you know i think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can't go and once you do that you lose everything i mean
yes i remember that i i had to do
what am i afraid of um i don't know if i'm really afraid of spending too much i just uh don't think that i need them you know i uh
uh citizens of the as and citizens of as and they can stand on their heads if they want too but i don't think that they're going they're going to change that and
they said that uh cars would cost two dollars and they would run forever
you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there
it's pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down and it's legal in a situation like that you know
i can only express myself so much because you know of everything that he taught me you know that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say i'm sorry you know it's like
if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying i got a problem
and uh you know people say you know it's expensive for to send kids to college but if if an everybody would be a little bit responsible you know it's like what what does it cost it costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose that they go to a state college and they live at home
you know you're found to be guilty i believe establishes the authority of our court system and i believe that you know that i do believe that capital punishment is uh
i know in uh it think it's i think it's i know that they have you know crimes punishable by death and i'm sure they hit a few every now and then and i wouldn't want to be one of them that are not guilty
but i know that they have like uh their crime rate it's not i don't think i can't remember which it's uh one of the and and they
and he want yeah he just told me this last week that he he said don't you remember i asked them to finance it at four years and they came back and they said that they had it figured for five and we'd already signed the papers
oh this last week we bought a sewing machine at and then i found that you could get the same machine better for less locally not much less but it was enough less and i found they locally serviced it
and uh i know that they helped a lot of those refugees
the drugs you know it's just incomprehensible and uh so i just think that i think that going to honor that and that he's going to put in some good leadership and i know the president of i believe
you know that that is doing something he is raising up some leaders and the people want him back as president bad but they have a rule in that he can't have another term
mine i think uh i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that
i don't know for me i don't know you know i can't say that i agree with because how can you be gentle unto all men and
and now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful and i hope that it holds out here after the summer
oh i imagine that i imagine gets really humid doesn't it
i know that i worry every now and then we're still on a well water we're not on city water
i understand uh my husband about once a weekend he'll go uh to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out
i mean that's all you need for like for like bullet charts and stuff you don't need them in four colors
we noticed that she was having problems uh problems limping and so forth and
and so she knew that i had the time and would be would enjoy it
i had taken the first one back i didn't think that it heated well enough it never did get anything but just moderately warm
i don't know it's i don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families and the blended families
yeah i guess that's what concerns me the most is they're they're so unstable that somebody like that could make uh decisions that would
yeah it's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons
well there there are quite a few um parks i guess state parks and there's a couple of national parks i guess that you can camp at
and they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely dire circumstances or anything they're not going to keep on if the car were older
uh and and the uh the statistics are something like twenty one out of twenty three it was which means that the are going to have a terrible year i think
an interesting concept of of how they do that but i agree with you i think that i think that's part of what
in that i think that he gave the people some uh uh a sense of the fact that that uh wars are really run by politicians
in some cases we would and i think that's what makes it so difficult
i think that's i think i think uh that's a little was a difficult part there and and i we didn't understand the culture we couldn't uh we had uh we had a a young lady that was fourteen that worked in our
to go beat up on people and i think that i think we need to a little more justice at home i'm not sure how we get that whether there's a connection there but
but i think that i think that that from a a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station uh i'm not sure i i'm
and this kind of thing and i think that it turns out though from what i understand has quite good i occasionally go to and uh there for a few days and watch the news and and i think really does have
have quite good news i think channel eight is the number one uh affiliate in the i think was saying that he course he pumping his own
you know when they thought uh they thought that if you gave them a free election they would vote for the
and i wouldn't don't know that i would advocate communism but uh the question is can a can you can a can a democracy uh afford the
well the interesting thing was is i had heard that and i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great and and it was the thing is it was a it was a good story
yeah well see that's in in there there no plan to build i think that there's some in there's some pulp
oh that's interesting you know that you know that there is a down side to all this you know about no good deed going unpunished that uh my mother sells um
they know that they've proven that
and it's very very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust i only have one guy that i know that i trust to work on my car and uh he's about uh sixty miles from here
and there's a lot of things out there that we could do uh for our own country let alone other countries and i think that we've got the the people power to do it it's just uh we need to
yeah i think uh covered that in his uh of the address this year when he said that you know it's time for
well they're all saying that they're going to do you know whatever is best for their campaign anyway
he went down to and noticed that it was hanging off where they had tried to break it off and they stole our tailgate off his truck
i hear that you know it if if you lock yourself out of your house and you try to get in your house it'll you give that half the time it takes you to break in uh a professional could break in in in half that time
now that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog that's a deterrent because they know that that dog's going to bark
told that you know i can't believe they killed them or or or who was it or
okay well is the one that jumped up and said that i can't believe they killed them and or went after his throat you dummy so i know that they die but i haven't told my husband we've both been wanting to see it
i was in the yeah yeah for myself i mean i think that military experience was fine it was just i just wish that there was something else that that that i could have done you know with
than just delegate it i think that they they had a great deal of um all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference and i mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family
the basic needs that the people don't have i think that that makes the problem most severe
the money that we used to spend we were spending on a account with and then money we were also buying stock with for that year we've taken that this year and said we're gonna pay off all of our credit cards and uh
that's the other financial thing i guess that we've done is with our life insurance is since i'm at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me
and i think that's that's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls it's not they're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much
you know they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's you know that it's going to you know that should be life but instead in in given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something
you hope that they think it's a bug and
because they're i guess that that that falls in and one of my other favorite shows is because of the kids
big difference between when people had gone to war before like compared to because i mean i know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that
yeah yeah i think there's still i i know that um i grew up in in the sixties and was part my family was real liberal and i think there's a lot of um
i sent off for stuff on it but i don't remember that much about it i know that they trained you in the language and um
okay so the latest movie i've seen that i thought was fantastic was
all over creation i don't know where in the world it is somewhere in somewhere i think that it was filmed
there i don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what but you could just tell that they had a love uh a love affair with their gardens with beautiful wild flowers and just i love the host of colors that just keep coming all you know year long
yeah that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put certain amount in savings every week and then it's not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or
hot and it's just you never really have like nice cool sixty five or seventy degree weather with sunshine you know and i really miss that i'm from originally and i miss some miss seasons that you know that we used to get up there that you just don't have down here
so i don't know what's the you know right thing to do but i really would hope that they would come up i know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable but the landfill have to do something special you know for those
i have heard that they've got these steamers you can rent now which make it much easier to get wallpaper off uh
uh reading about and and i suppose that there is uh justification for taking everybody if you take anybody
think that we have gotten into much too legalistic of society and that we we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and far too little on achieving justice
he said that that was barred uh by the court
pickup so they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was uh
well let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because
okay we're energized um painting interesting uh guy called me when she called me the computer called me i thought that they were reading my mind i'm in the middle of um going out for bids to have my house painted
one of the schools high schools or or junior highs i guess and she said that that she had a a choice she could either have taken tennis or weight lifting so she chose to take weight lifting
that won all those this year i haven't seen that have you seen that one yet
and i think the people were smart enough to realize that you know that that i think they're afraid of him is what they are the population is is afraid to speak out against him and
on my driveway i guess that's what they do and then i had to wheel barrow it in but uh you know you can improve your own soil there but the soil isn't the greatest gardening soil
can i guess your favorite team if you had one might be the well i can understand that i you know i kind of like the too
it's just a bad deal course there are emergencies you know that you you know probably need to have a card
and to think that people live on the water daily is kind of odd to me
yeah i understand that we we have a real similar situation ours have uh
he said that when he graduated the day after he passed his bar examine there in
it it astound you realize that the government gives every man woman and child money
huh well you would think that they would get that in the uh when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury
you would think that those would come out and i know they automatically when you go through uh
but i find that if i sit on that seat too long it hurts
well see there's no way of knowing that's you know that's the problem like the product i sell
and uh reputable and they know that hey we're backing it one hundred percent
three i think that i know of for cans for people have pop and they put them right near where they have the time cards and it works great and they have one in the room where the snack machines are too
she really enjoyed it but but it was on a on a higher level you know where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did and i liked that
it really is it it's sad to think that we would do that to people and you know i've seen them on with uh bed sores and
i went for a couple and i didn't know that there there was even a cut off or anything
the the investigator yeah he he got off right away and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that so i figure that that will make me biased and i won't be chosen
uh be required to do service public service for a year or two and i was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family
i realize that that i mean
things are quite different there in terms of that there's less of a sense of privacy in fact it's said that no language has a word for privacy certainly a language i know doesn't but just has a word for loneliness loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different
but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms
of course they find that the choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if it is for your you know you can choose something you really want which is a wonderful thing but it does seem like an awful lot of my uh
i must say that there are a couple of arguments against uh strong gun control which i find very compelling although most of the people who argue gun control with me i find um
uh kilograms and i think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute an inch is two point fifty four centimeters how on earth am i every going to do the math
uh-huh i saw that i saw that the other day i don't don't drink soda pop but i saw a two liter soda pop bottle so yeah things like that
oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this and
but it doesn't they don't really say that you know you're you're always going to have great career conditions
i don't know that i believe every secretary in every company needs to be
uh no i haven't i don't know that i could do that that looks awful tiring
when he's not right at the door in the morning i really worry that something's happened to him that somebody he's got in a fight or you know somebody's hit him and and uh and if he doesn't come by mid morning then i really get scared but he's always come back eventually so
uh you know i really i have a son that's sixteen and i think you know eventually you know he'll be of of drafting age and i think oh gosh do i want him to go and yet i'm proud to be an and i know that we have a
and it's kind it's kind of scares me not that i don't want them here and not that i don't appreciate the fact that you know that they have rights too but on the other hand you feel like almost they're they're invading us to the point where they're going to take over
well i think things come easy for them too but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the i don't
she had a nursing degree and she was able to make it but she said in just you never know what's going to happen and i thank that i did go to college and got a degree because otherwise i don't know how i would be able to raise my children
yeah i do too but i think it needs to continue to change and i mean i think it there's still not equality as far as uh paychecks for men and women i think that the we still have a long way to go
that well that one certainly is high i i worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening so i like to reverse that trend and say i'd like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better
i know that's what i'm saying that that pensions you see just like you were you're saying you've only got uh so many years say you work for two three companies if you take your pension with you after you're vested
no no there isn't i i'm saying that's the question what do you think could be better and i'm saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will
my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine and i have one too and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long
and i think that we even got our famous hundred year old uh pecan trees from and all that too
it is very interesting without question i i don't really know that they have the answers in those books that they they make conclusions in them that may or may not be
it says i haven't quite figured that out i thought it was eight or nine but seems like too nice a prize for nine just nine calls doesn't it
uh the reason i said that because i've had about uh three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of i guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever
and some people say go to but i don't i don't have an answer to the crime rate it's sad that is a sad situation i i'd like to go down to you know and i keep hearing that you know the government and and the crime rates pretty high too that that is sad
yeah it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs you know that the everyone has a boss of course uh
oh i i agree i i think that that there's a lot of inconsistencies uh
was to to for an education and then sports sports of course is part of the education i don't think that sports has to make a lot of money or you do away with it i don't know why they don't keep fencing and all that you know and
and i and i i just think that amateur sports should stay in universities that's where it's at
oh well great oh fantastic fantastic experience i've got two as i said i've got one in at now in and one at home and uh i always say that i've learned so much more from them than i than ever taught them
and then you can kind of keep an you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want but at least you see what's going on and uh you always have your house welcome then then your children'll think that uh you know you're cool parents and all that you know
we need to get that through we we have said that i've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two year two terms is enough for all of them
i always thought that we did but i don't i don't i don't i don't know what they are right now
i i do have some sympathy with uh you know of course we have this big problem not a problem but i think that we need to do something with uh the immigration of back and across forth across
yeah i was talking to someone i can't remember who it was but he was a small businessman and he said that the banks were calling he borrowed some money and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away
not all of it i don't know how much he lost but uh they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit and it always would it always would increase you know it always would uh
it it still a lot of the workers don't understand that uh they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them you know
spend their time here rather than produce you know and they think that well i'm paid anyway so it doesn't matter you know
oh i know it and i have gone back and after i i graduated i read some of the old classics that i just bluffed my way through and have found that i enjoy them quite a bit too uh
you can look at it if you know if if you want to say that it's proving that
now we've let some people go uh that well it was found that drugs were used in their system now i don't know how would handle it they haven't pursued it you know
uh if there's some uh problem i know there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines
and then i also had a friend who was uh just around some people that were smoking cocaine and he tested positive on cocaine now then you always wonder well is he just saying that you know
and i think that's a shame i mean i must admit sometimes i do like a buffet but uh but i think that they just tend to make you you say oh well i've have got all i can eat or or you know it's one of these situations where
yeah the more money they put into it i can see that because i knowing from institutes of learning like that i know that they've got to get their money somewhere and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it so
because we both were raised you know that way you know where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a to be the babysitter
so there could be a lot of things that they could put you know that that they use to uh that they are testing with
you know how they can do some of the tests unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution you know like in or or the bigger cities where it it tends to get stuck there you know that you have a lot more particles in the air
and this article said that they've got a real problem that um you've got toxins and and uh bacteria in the manure that is what it's doing is it's going through uh they don't have a very deep um oh
yeah which it's not that way now but i think that there is just that i think that it's just countries are slower in coming around
i just think that has something to do with why are tend to be
so you know and yet they yet people get very frightened when they see the moving in and the the moving in in certain areas of technology you know that we use to dominate and it's like well you know
well to some of them i guess it doesn't matter you know that maybe they've got enough coming in to to take care of it but
if you treat them right they're not the gas guzzlers i think that they've got the reputation to be i'm convinced that uh or whoever it is made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes
the exact uh specifications are for i know that they uh have capital punishment for certain crimes and that's probably the way i feel about it is
yeah i think that's what aggravates a lot of people is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in who was out in six months
well especially being a college student you your i don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving you know that effects the budget especially around uh time it's the end of the semester you've got finals and you've got lots of bills i would suspect
and i've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and didn't with the other and they said that they'd exercise the one that had exercised was three or four times easier and
um let's see when i each time that i thought that the were going to get killed i cried um i cried the first time when the um
yeah i didn't enjoy her i i she was too much of a opposite of and i think that's what they try to do but i think we wanted to see there or somebody like her
i was going to say i didn't ever watch but i heard that's what killed it that that uh interplay died when they got married and so the show died
yeah especially when they're not quite to the age of understanding that they're hurting you know that they they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk and
um well like i say i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth like teenagers to go
charity that's put it together but i know that that helps a lot with training and um
you know that it compare can you can compare your house to anything around there
so you think that you want to move away from the big city huh
oh i bet and what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way
and i think that sort of goes hand in hand so it's it's difficult for them
you know i have friends that struggle financially and and they both do have to work it's a matter of not necessarily uh that she might want to stay home or he as well but you know that they need the money
i don't know i guess that's what's happening to me but i i i think it's just starting um its
i think that's that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country's being run is that um the the election
with openness and light i understand that i would love that too
is that true i didn't know that i was thinking that is one solution to it
i really don't know you know in in the uh in you know i hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears you know some reason or other
i had wondered sometimes i knew that there was a lot of a lot of effort and a lot of work went into a lot of that and i just wondered if if it lasted and if it took you know like yeah
you know one of the the best uh television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a morning on and it was for children and it was hosted by
i don't know that you do if it's random then it's random and that's not necessarily fair
uh but i know that they sent that the job i had before that well the job i have have now requested my uh uh
so i don't know if i wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion
well no i don't think they can they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i i didn't i mean they they don't know that i don't use drugs they just tested me once
uh so they didn't know how it was going to work they're thinking that we were going to have to get a modem so that we could you know uh and a decks machine so that uh in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so
yeah they'll just i do too just go by your social security number and then look at your qualifications that you know that you have
in the summer i'll plant petunias or something that that's colorful and like that blooms a lot but uh haven't done that yet it i i kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time but i think we're probably past that now i probably should go buy some but
oh i agree i think that people are getting off too easy they're getting they're getting paroled too easily they're just getting uh put on probation or something because the prisons don't have enough room so they get they get
well i and i don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to to look professional
in hindsight seen some things that i wished that you know i had done something about that was you know within my power or uh
uh in regard to taxes let's say that um you have something that the
they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather you know it wasn't just a super bad storm but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the the late spring time
but um they do that and then we use uh different chemicals and things and i know that you know they're
yeah i don't know that i read anything strictly labeled self-improvement how about you
yeah well i guess too if i thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem
but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time and that's always kind of bothered me
well i remember uh thinking i think it was the last time i did hear that we get about the average maybe even a little more
and we found that the you know what was one one great handy things was this uh uh uh hamburger helper
of course uh now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence uh they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five
um but i had lived in my own little bubble up until that time and and after traveling around the world a few times i realized that things ain't the way they seem
you know and i and i think that i agree with you this is exactly the right course i mean that's an internal problem to it has nothing to do with us
that's i knew you were going to say that i wanted i want to go see that
if they want to have want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that i've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county that's fine too
yeah well i think it's going to be a lot easier now i just heard that they lowered the prime lending rate
um i i think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together
i yeah i i think that i think very few spend quality time i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff stuff like that i think that um
being mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings
i think that um it's going to get even worse
yeah i agree with that i think that the law the law is on who can buy a gun are are way too lax i think that i think that the
and even even when in when we camped i really didn't notice a problem with bugs and i noticed that i know that i said that's i've i've lived back east before um and
that's what it is here yeah that's why we're at a point now we've uh we're adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what happens is uh you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we'll be staying in so
or is it just i think that like you said television is it just that more people think there is like excitement in it you know i mean people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something
um what was it like living there i mean did you find that people appreciated having the privilege of being
but i but i don't but i know it's not a end all and be all that's the problem i have with it in they think it's an end all and be all they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something else gas somebody
yeah i just don't think that uh you can rehabilitate i mean i just don't uh
i don't know i i guess i also wish that uh companies would look more at cost of living increases instead of just merit reviews
yeah and and you can't really argue with them because they've always been successful so you know what can you tell them really well i guess that's what i know about benefits okay
well we haven't been in years down near and i had a meeting down there today and i saw that and i i said gee i remember that they offer you um authentic feeding or or piano bar
yeah everybody every child that i even know that eats vegetables um below below five years old still after a certain age realize that there is something called
and uh as we were doing it too everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities to play basketball waiting around for us and as we walked out i was limping and i'm like oh great i have purple tights on you know
but but they love it i mean they they they think that they're getting you know you say um sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell
yeah that's that's a bad situation i think that probably i think most companies now as far as entry you know exams require that i think they should
right right and of course you know they they did specifically single them out when we started you know that they were going to do all them first
plus you know you you want to think that that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share
it was like five or six dollars i can't remember exactly you know that we paid for the book to be printed and it's not uh it's not a hard back book it's just a
and um you know they may not even discuss it they go out and cash that check thinking that you know they've got something maybe they've won something you know somebody sent them something free and go out and spend it
and um it's just unreal i mean i don't like credit cards i wish that they would come up with some other way to you know the only way you could use them is if you were
but um i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to pay out
right and i hear so many people saying well i wish this would change i wish that and you know but they didn't go vote
and i think it just it revolutionized an where a woman thinks that a way you know just like now my daughter
because that's like my daughter now she says that you know maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then
well i i hope that they will change uh but but i'm i just i know it's going to be a slow change uh i
i think that's that's pretty nice but i have to say that since we've come here we haven't done it too much though we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or or any of that but that's a that's a nice benefit to have
where i go to church now there are five other people that went to school at the same time in the same class as i and it it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same
is that right i i heard that there was some stuff on the on the radio that was equivalent to
when you say that you grew up uh in the sixties i take it that was the uh teenage type years or uh
schooled in it and i i've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it i played a little bit of piano i've i continue to think that i want to do it and i never have the discipline to stay with it
i find it very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy i particularly like the music i don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation
and i found that i really like and i particularly like of and both of them i had as much fascination of the background music i think going on as i did to the theme of the shows
and i have uh returned about every four or five years to thinking that i would like to to do something about it
exactly uh and at the same time i think that i receive on on the order of
uh probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it
and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control and you one's feeling obligated because uh some sense of of the way the ritual is played out
a a negative step to make and i think that that they would need to reassess that
um i know that there are young people
acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on on the order of what i quoted to someone because that's what the experience they want
but i do have friends who live in the city and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing
that he's popular you know that he can do the job then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want i think the reason why we've got these guys in congress is because of the fund-raising rules i mean
let's see i'm trying to think oh have you heard that that i'm trying to think of what company it was there was a company that was going to
it's just one of those things you just do it and be done with it and don't worry about you know but i do know that there are several sites i didn't i wasn't aware that was one of them but i think was one
my spare time usually involves something with the kids yeah you know hobbies we i can't really say that we have hobbies it's more like maybe
i think that and also to get totally off crawfish the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps
and um i also had the supervision that i needed while i was growing up and i hope that i can provide that for my child too
well i found that they they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on
i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that that may be good
but anyway i think that um we are paying a lot in taxes but i think that
i think the the gun clubs serve a useful purpose in fact i'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to uh show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon
and uh it's funny how uh how i i uh i got acquired this animal uh when i was uh married my uh ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that she needed uh the woman needed someone to babysit
yeah right that your supposed to appreciate them well my my dog when i came home uh when i come home in evenings she my dog greets me at the door i don't know that a cat would do that uh
i i don't know that i'd uh that i'd trade my dog in for the world uh it was about two years ago she got sick on me and i took her to the uh to the vet's because she wasn't eating
so i took his suggestion and i uh took the the dog to a hospital a dog hospital and they said that they'd keep her there for three days
yeah it i think it will because they're both in their in their seventies and uh the cat uh although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes turned out it turns out to be a uh pleasant experience for them uh i think that they enjoy that
and you know this this was her father uh you know that that got killed you know just cold-blooded murder him and three other people and but still
i i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because i used to get it during the week
i i'd you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and
i think that yeah i think that we need to really address what we've done here and and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives a much broader outlook
