um but they don't always work and then you know they try to raise taxes more and i don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work you know and the taxes get raised
it's it's really neat i don't think uh hardly anybody lives there because it's just kind of like you know tourists
his it kind of shows how his um best friend this little girl deals with his death and how i think maybe how children should deal with death maybe
oh i don't know well i'm used to it now but sometimes it still gets gets to me but there's not much i can really do no
oh me too i hope that happens to me someday i mean i don't mind doing stuff um i have a boyfriend and like i'll make him dinner and stuff but you know and he'll help me do the dishes i don't want him you know
really neat to seeing all what educated minority um person who really knows what they're talking about and
oh i don't know yeah i know who you're talking about
no i never did didn't have the i guess i didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing and of course i was at that you know stage of my life where i had to be taken places places i couldn't go by myself but
well i don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not
yeah i well i have in a while for a while i haven't gotten any because i just find that i'm not reading what i'm getting because uh
and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they or just real talented i should say lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching uh others have there's one gal that's in the uh
um i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight or or should i say seven i mean she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's gonna excel just naturally she does have to really work at it but
and after it started to sprout put in sunny window and it's it just grew like crazy but i don't have any flowers on it i don't know how long that takes or if there's anything i need to do differently but
oh that's why i asked you i guess it you know it does go in cycles and not everyone got theirs right away
i don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than uh what are some of the things they don't recycle oh one thing i thought about the other day were batteries just everyday regular batteries
and you just have to set the time and say okay this is gonna be it
yeah well that's they say it it all it takes is about five ten minutes a day
and you know and as the kids got older i made them you know help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too
well we did too and and i remember the one daughter saying we had a a a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree
they say uh it football attracts more men because of the you know you the you see the the physical aggression on the field and supposedly psychologists say that uh
it that you miss sitting home in your parlor you know uh with a with a a six pack of beer and some uh potato chips you know you you miss that and and any professional sport i think you miss that
i i know a lot i think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort
the uh teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them and it's very important i feel
so i don't know i i guess we're kind of in the same boat we haven't had to look very carefully for child care
and uh you know you hear in the newspaper you hear on the and you read the newspaper quite often of of people that you know
we've uh we've been married for about ten years and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh
and the in a sense become unteachable they think they know all there is to know in their area set path and you know come in and put my time in from nine to five and
and uh i've seen what it has done in other countries and so i don't think uh
you know a a quality difference i don't know you wouldn't you didn't notice the difference did you
well guess what we get to talk about the weather uh
lights up the whole sky and even on a on a actually i've i've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky it's a cloudless night
and and yes all those areas so i imagine have you skied before
where they buy something now and say well i'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale and then i can go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month when i'm being paid
well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldn't be able to do that
he's a he's a medical doctor right now he had to you know once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree he had to take out some loans and he's he's working to pay those off
you know once you get past uh the initial stages of it that there's different options you can use and and uh the student loans are are a good option and
and we do do that fact i was just reading an article you mentioned painting your bathroom
no i don't think so um i started playing when i was in elementary school actually we lived really close to a par three golf course and i'd go up there with friends after school a couple times every week and then
well you know you it seems like well you go to work every weekend play maybe one two tournaments a month and come in about tenth you'd still be doing pretty well
you know buy keep auto workers working right now but i feel that the have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while if i were to buy another car i would be uh
uh because i have a an economy car right now which is okay but uh i think i i'd like to move on to something a little better
so i guess you'd have to say if i was looking i would definitely be looking for a foreign car
i believe it i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually
uh i know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten late years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but
well i really don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the case i mean i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well that's great that's gonna lower our national expenditures but then you're gonna have people on welfare and they're not putting taxes in
too many i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're uh you know worthy of working for us i really don't see that that's a very very valid uh
well i think i think what you i think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
there's too many cases where it can you know there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing i don't think there's any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs so we don't want him here
but uh i mean i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that it's such a a big deal i mean if your employer's not going to trust you or you know it i just i think it's a whole trust issue i just can't see it
well you know i i can see how they can say in the work place we you don't want them to smoke but when somebody leaves work i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their lifestyle at all
yeah i mean that's better than who came out and said no i will not read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i can't follow through on this but it seems to me that uh
and then i'm gonna go on and just forget everything that i said or you know it doesn't seem that it's gonna make much of a difference
you know i guess the cars had a bad reputation but i haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones i've had
yeah i mean even even if it's just little details it seems like uh they you know like uh there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while and and it's clearly just a a design problem there
it's you know we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but
because uh i guess um i mean well ninety two's granted but the new ones you know fourteen to sixteen is what they go for
guess the dealer comes out okay you know i don't know what kind of i don't know what corporate kind of hit the i don't know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off of it
i don't know if you've heard of but it's a very transient community a lot of people from everywhere it's just north of
uh not that i am but other people seem to be and i would love to know why but i mean they do they have i i would i really would i mean they just have beautiful beautiful homes and they have everything
the kids only wear name brand things to school and it's one of these things well it does you know it really does because i'm a single mom and i have a thirteen year old now and uh you know it does i mean we do it to a point but um
and i just think it's really awful and i i'm with you on that you don't hear too many people say this but i think it's a very long day
and so i just find this a real problem i think if they're gonna be there all day they should find time
so what does that tell you the it tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time
uh i don't know if you have that up there but it's it's a very good company that sells sterling silver things and
and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends and i called there to see if they had it and the lady was very nice and i said my goodness i said you've been very nice what's your name
and she told me and i said well i really appreciate it i said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store and it turned out she was the assistant manager
so i don't know and i think it could be used to hassle somebody if someone was out to get you
yeah i think you do you feel very good after you exercise i think it's worth making the time for yourself you owe it to yourself and i think you do accomplish more after that
and it's just uh i think it's well worth it i just demand that time for myself now i've learned to do that and it you know and it i think it just benefits you all around
i mean no you probably know i don't know nobody talks about it so i don't think we do
and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to and i never did i just went back and signed the papers and i knew nothing about my car when i got it nothing i didn't know how anything worked
i know what i'm seeing here at my well my job is that people are having their children much later in life
yes i'm i'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden
i don't know and then i got some nice uh mums at that i put in the pots out there and i thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather
so i don't think any of it comes back but i don't know maybe sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to
another state i can't remember but she told me about the we talked about basketball
i have i was trying to think of the one i went to a couple of weeks ago but i forgot it already
well it would be a lot fun you know there's there's good and there's bad and my experience in wasn't my favorite for sure but
we didn't know we looked at each other we said things like spaghetti you know things like that and we finally followed some kids he told us where to get off we followed these kids with uh gym bags and we figured that must be the sports arena
you never know yeah yeah she feels that way you know and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with but
we just feel better doing it this way so i don't know what day we'll stop we we were about to stop one day this year and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats and so
and i i just don't know what i would do if i had to do that i know the hospital that i work in is big hospital and they provide child care and of course they charge for it but at least all the nurses can leave their children and
it's very wealthy town and we're not part of that but i it is you know and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better
to buy a home and and to raise a family i don't know how they're gonna do it
and so i don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again i don't think that ever will go backwards
but i don't know what effect it's gonna have on these kids now when they grow up how they're gonna feel about it
it you know it could lead to another type thing you know where where there's just too much material things and and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things
i guess uh some child care each one of them and now they're in school so it's all over but uh
i you know i think those things get
but i think you know you you have to look through a place and you have to get a feel for um
and you knew how you knew how to do the framing
i'm i'm not sure i understand what you mean
i do think yeah that's true i think in places i think in places like people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off
i guess uh i think they've lost their compass and uh
yeah the immediacy just isn't there and um uh i also think that one one of the problems and actually i don't think this i think this is a cultural problem
well that's exactly what i was going to say now there seem to be really three reasons for education one is education for civic duty one is education for economic reasons and one is education for civilization i mean and i think that one is
and um i'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is and i'm really sad to say this i never thought i would have but i really think that uh the educational establishment has become part of the problem
so you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to uh admit or not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
is the government against the individual you need some kind yeah they need the protection of ordinary citizens i think that's really the only thing i guess where i would like to see the system system change is uh
if you're gonna use it for a lifetime i suppose it's worth it because um imagine if i go and sharpen them myself uh it won't last
those are two things that i think are going on although they i i don't think the politicians would tell you that
i don't know if i would rank that second but um since i have three boys uh it it can turn out to be important you know in a in a given year dental can dental expenses can really kill you
you know the like how they said the more i hear about it
yeah i've heard the i've heard the construction's pretty good on and
uh you know what i miss though basements
is that what happens up there a lot uh that's that that's mostly what i hear about is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen that's the most prevalent crime uh
no i it wasn't that big a deal uh when i when i think of crime i think of stuff that that affects affects other people like people getting you know killed or raped i think rape is one of the worst crimes
yeah if if that uh you know the sooner a a a year's plenty of time you know for something to come out i guess then you know there's been guys in jail for six years and the other guy admits that he did it and they
a good uh a good way for vengeance you know for the relatives and and family members you know what i mean
that's a little bit to uh it it's like they're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing you know what i mean
you know when they had that the music and stuff like that and the and that kind of rock and roll so he likes that and my mom always liked that kind of stuff my mom likes like uh
but i think nursing homes can be good just depends on what kind they are you know an you need to check them out
and know what they're doing with that
so i'm always behind i'm i'm not i'm never really up to date on all that stuff but i know what i like when it's uh when i like a sound a certain kind of sound yeah
the more now i live in downtown and i uh you know i've seen uh i've seen cases on in the news and all where where you know uh a a
i see yeah i uh i was gonna say because i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for it says paper on it you know and uh if
uh i've heard uh you know uh in residential situations i live in a dorm and i've heard in residential situations uh like in
the only responsibility of the of the patron is to separate them and then the the uh i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them and it doesn't cost the patron anything doesn't really cost the uh department
i guess i guess by what you said you're you you don't feel you're uh privacy has been invaded invaded anytime recently
uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to you to tell them you know that you're not interested or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep asking you you know and and
you know if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look you know i want my name unlisted or i want my you know
uh well i'm in graduate school and so i read a lot of books but i don't know if i consider very many of them good
i haven't read a book for enjoyment since i guess around um i received received uh
uh uh blues are okay i tell you i do like um i grew up on blue grass music my dad is a big blue grass fan and so um
uh-huh yeah i i agree with you i you know i would even think that um uh i could in theory take that alone a you know a step further and say anybody in any job you know if the corporation felt like uh and and this is why i mean uh drugs are
the biggest problem i think to face today i mean it's what drives crime it's what drives
uh yeah you know whether whether in in the case that you brought up you know whether uh you know whether if it's a policeman and he's working with uh the public and he has a and has a gun in his holster or or even you know if it's a guy at cooking a burger i think
yeah what do you think about um you know something that kind of concerns me is uh you you know you and i are tested for for whatever work we happen to do do you think there should be drug testing for political officials
um-hum do you do you worry do you worry any about uh uh you
um-hum although lately i have noticed you know even if i gain like two pounds i start i start feeling it and
yeah there are um i'm living in a dorm right now and so right downstairs there's a facility and i really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than i do because there's a facility right downstairs where all you know all we have to do is
of what's happening with air pollution and how uh how horrible it really is um i i notice people in in seem to say well sure there's air pollution but you know
yeah that is good i i like uh we have cable i really like watching the old at shows you know where you get to watch and and
yeah he published a paper uh couple of years ago i think didn't he well well one that i read does he publish a little quite a bit
i found when when i get when i get with my uh old college buddy we we usually rent uh good gladiator movie or two
i haven't seen that much change you know what i mean i'm kind of young still i don't know what how much it changed in the last
people's uh views on on relationships has changed you know and now we have now we have several you know we we have to worry about and we have to worry about
yeah and i like to listen to that and catch you know you i don't get i don't get a lot of uh sometimes i don't get the current events you know because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with uh
uh which i like i don't i don't like to you know i like to save the editorial information or the the politically uh weighted information you know for the for a different section i like just to get to the you know find out what's happening
no no that's the problem uh you you know you see you see knee surgery on the front page you know
you know how how about you uh i guess in you guys have several papers that are pretty
you know typically you if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself
um-hum yeah that that seems to make sense that leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the uh kind of the rate for different incidents
you know we're we're much better off playing uh ninth that's right you know we'll we'll do we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and and hum it
and i really don't uh agree with that i don't think anyone who would commit a uh a crime that would get them the death penalty
right luckily i don't either i mean you know maybe my cat would get sick but i mean usually that's not so much that it would throw me off
but you so you know what i'm saying yeah
well this is another way that i'm making a little extra money so that was you know nice that i tripped over this opportunity and you're actually my first call
i think uh if i personally had to put one of my parents in a nursing home they would have to be pretty bad off
i think there was a couple that were schizophrenic and i remember one time watching one of the uh schizophrenic patients actually go out on i don't know what they call it a binge or whatever you want to say it but
she grabbed a hold of this and it was kind of funny when i look back at it but i mean i remember the patient getting very upset
just really upset i mean he's what the hell are you think you're doing you know and i laughed at it then but then i'm thinking you know if i had to put my parents in that nursing home i wouldn't want them there
and yeah yeah and you have more competition and i think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community
right an unlimited source so they they think well i'll go out and buy a four hundred dollar toilet seat and i could have went to and bought it for you know ten or fifteen i mean that kind of thing and uh
that mark up their amounts and say you know i'll give you a legal pad for five bucks and you can go to another shop and get if for maybe sixty cents or ninety or ninety cents that kind of thing so
uh relief for having children i mean there is none i mean i think i paid just as much as when i didn't have her
but you're still gonna owe the government as much money so by the end of this coming year what's gonna happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings uh account
well i don't think people think they can make a difference and when you've got candidates as you do it's candidates that have money and it's backed by big business
this government itself isn't working just like the communist government of uh the old uh and maybe that's gonna happen to where they'll say hey we're fed up
and each state take care of itself and no government type of uh you know where you have to pay out to federal or whatever i don't know who knows but
is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well you know
this is kind of iffy you know are they really on drugs or are they on you know what i'm saying where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person
uh is on drugs or make up they may make up their mind that let's get rid of this employee you know what i'm saying
exactly and it's a they can that uh if it does come out positive the first time they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take you know what i mean it it's kind of like
unless there's a big issue going on like when we were at war then i think everybody was glued to the to find out what was going on
if you're watching for the weather even though it's very hard to predict what's going on they'll kind of say well there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever this is the what is expected but a lot of times things happen and change here
you know where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever so
anyway i don't know if our time is getting up here or it's got to be fairly close to that
i don't know if you feel the same but uh when it comes to telling kids that they have to do uh two or three years of service into some kind of community i don't know if that's
uh appropriate for a government to suggest that and say you know you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen or you know in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do
and to me that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year but to tell them that they had to do two years there after post high school of community service i'm
and teaching him that there is a whole community that is is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever and that's i think they have done that and
judges have said well you know this is what you're gonna get for um you know a misdemeanor misdemeanor or something you may end up having to do some kind of community service so i could see that as
um you you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever i would say the crimes would probably be you know if you went in for a certain crime there might be somebody that has has done a crime even worse than what you have so you're dealing with people
because sometimes i wonder you know being a uh lay person out there of not uh knowing exactly exactly what's going on in space
to me the all this uh space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth
and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space and what it you know not that i want everything to halt and
mainly because uh the space program has taught us that there is no other place for us i mean this is it i mean if we would've
it's it brings down the fact that this earth is it it's it for us you know what i mean
you know and uh i think of uh i i'm sure you probably have heard of the program that's going on currently out in the desert uh
i don't know how many people could live up in space uh for any length of time i mean i
it leads you to kind of say well i'm not going to take it out i'm going to keep it and uh keep it in there and let it grow so that some way
it's put into our savings account and we don't see it then it works out to where you know you don't look at it you just look at the checking account and say this is what we have for money and that's it so
and i think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because
uh-huh yeah yeah i know what you mean and that's true i mean yeah it it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position sure
well that's it you know and and i've kind of looked around uh at that uh too because uh salary wise i don't think i'm making as much with a big corporation because i think when you look at big corps
i don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people you know what i'm saying it it's
and it's kind of like we're the first to do it so i don't know if it's done because we're we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for uh
it it sure does and i think it it is reflecting like you said i think society as a whole
the each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or you know the other things that have occurred so uh
i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten i guess i would rate it a five in the aspect that i wouldn't want everybody to have guns
so i guess you know being that i come from a hunting family i'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons
a lot of the more complex weapons i would say yes we need to put restrictions on them
out to kill somebody more than likely somebody would see it you know what i'm saying versus a
um you know and i don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sits down to them and say this gun can kill you you know and don't ever play with it
um so i don't know if that makes a difference or what but
feel to place their children into care and you know it's our society saying yes this um you need this job
um you know you think of and you know just the the background of you know teaching himself to read he didn't go to college he didn't
i think they understand that is trying to make a change and that we cannot run
so i mean sure they have weapons to kill us over and over and over but
sure oh sure sure that's really scary and to the point that you kind of say to yourself especially home day care i mean i think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out
getting into that um health cost has continued to rise and i think uh there's people that to me it's the fundamental uh life life of a person um
um i think if uh they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and
yeah and i don't know if you can have that with a universal system maybe you know there's a way of working that out but
well we do the same i mean it's i think uh people are changing their viewpoints of you know it's getting harder and harder to survive
well i don't know if there's gonna be a solutions to the budget
saying well we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the moneys uh
for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them four hundred five hundred dollars
exactly and i don't think uh it's ended up being i mean it gave people jobs
what kind of future will they have when they think back and say well my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference and i think people are trying
okay for as far as um i would think the probably the uh worst substance that's probably um or started to say the uh what causes the most air pollution is probably the car
yes yeah that's very true um other than that uh i don't know oh okay oh okay we'll try to be real quick here the other thing then is because i don't know how long they want us to talk it
into the air because he opened it and i don't know if there was something wrong with it or it his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that and i was thinking how many other people
okay well one thing i guess both of us have very much aware of the equality
yeah those are very few i think those men don't last very long in relationships because they think women know what they want
well emotionally i think uh women do a little bit uh i think that's the gap is coming closer as um
anyway but okay that sounds great and uh i don't know if we need to talk anymore or whatever
that's pretty similar but i find that with these magazines i keep going back to them getting ideas looking back and saying jeez there was a flower garden in there that i seen that i would like to have some ideas you know so you get a lot of ideas from them
before back in nineteen uh eighty six and i thought well i'll give it a try again because you get tired of one magazine and you need to try and change
basically i can tell you that i like just about every music there is except for uh uh real hard hard rock i really can't get into that but
they have the saxophone playing and it's so funny because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself oops are you okay come here honey oh my daughter just fell come here
i didn't think they were either i thought the sentencing was done by the judge and it's either guilty or not guilty
which is taxes where you most people forget about them because you've got you know you can't always get your back at the end of the year but so you know and then you know like a five percent i'm paying forty percent tax
yeah well i mean i think there's some people there you there clearly are some things where you need infrastructure and you need
you know you know there are things government does better you know i think government does a better space program
you know i think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because wants it that way or
and you know then you look at how well they're managed you know i don't think we're getting our money's work out worth out of there i think it's all going into into bureaucrats
right you you can apologize nicely but you know you know i think you know the the price you know it i've heard quotes you know it's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned
the i i think that you know and the way it's being used now it's like you listen to you know well where are we gonna impose drug you know it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in is also saying you know capital make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer
and again i don't think these people care they risk their lives everyday
so you know but you look at our our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to to like or someplace that does you know it it it's impossible to make a case that it's it's affecting it in any way
you know the you know what the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society
and what if it just turned out to be genetic or biochemical in origin so if someday we can go to and say well the problem is you you've got an endorphin imbalance and you know if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society
well i mean and it seems like it it rarely does happen you know it's not it's not used that often you know at least here in but i think it's something that needs to stay i really do
and she loves that because it it they arrange activities for them all day long and then they have um where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go
in the future you know she she knows it's not gonna be like that all the time and she's just wondering well what's gonna happen to me and and i you know it's i guess it's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that but
because i remember her in her letters telling me she she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat so i'm assuming it's something like that too so
um paper plates and paper cups and i don't do that anymore i don't know why i just don't i just from just from socializing with her so
well that's good i you know unfortunately doesn't have doesn't they don't i don't know they don't do anything like that or i i you know i read those little slips that come in with your utility bills
you know the little um i don't know if you know the little character they had one uh on that kind of type of thing and how children can
yeah it's amazing what a minivan can do we went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan and pulled uh um the little trailer behind the pop up trailer and uh it's so it's really amazing how much a minivan can can you know what it can do
but as far as writing checks out and paying taxes i think it's pretty high but i i'm uh you know i i guess that's where we have to be where it we have to keep raising them for to keep some of the things that that we have and
you sure do know a lot know a lot
uh the explosions and that kind of thing my husband will say how'd you know about that and i said yes it happened at such and such time and that's so that that's different for me so i usually find out when exactly when it happens and that kind of thing
uh-huh yeah i know what you're saying
so it just seems like with me staying home we had that big cut but we save more i don't know how and i don't know why but we it seems like we do
i guess that's kind of like the way we do we i don't i don't know how it comes it just seems like we save a little bit more whereas where i was working
i guess i guess i'd have to go with uh i i'd be for it
you know but i guess if they you know you know there's uh i i guess there's some companies that aren't that are doing it and it it seems to be working out so
i don't know how they thought of this it's going to be on a cruise
um every year and they go camping and she says they have the greatest time and she says usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person but she said they all go camping and they have a really good time for the whole weekend
you know it there's only so long you can do that and to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts and a lot of the teachers
you know and then there i know that there are some parents that say how do i get my kids in that and yet they don't qualify but unfortunate that they don't qualify because i think everybody would benefit from these programs
well you know one of the books that i did read that i was reading and i stopped because it's so
yeah i agree i know exactly what you're saying
but the kids were i mean they really had some great opportunities but that what you were alluding to earlier is you know women who work for minimal wage and
that really i think i don't it's been awhile since i've looked at my youngest child is eight so it's been a little while since i've looked into actually day care centers but they are you know the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since and so
i think we i think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children we have three children who are eleven nine and eight
you know i know we're not supposed to do this long distance but actually i'm getting a call i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting could i ask you to hold one minute i'll be right back excuse me just a moment they're gonna get mad
hello i'm so sorry that was my daughter's leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow meeting
i think as parents we really enjoy them and in our own personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel i'm sure i'm sure that's coming though but they're wonderful kids
well if you're from you must be very artsy-craftsy everyone i've ever known from the can do everything with their hands
i think when babies i think afghans and and the crocheted little sweaters and
you know telling them that there's there's protestors out here
uh someone was telling me that there is a uh uh there's still an office in uh you know staffed with with people there and in that are researching to find a cure for polio
it's uh i mean it's it's tough i mean there's there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations i guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot
um see i mean my mom taught as a second language and and and she was dealing mostly with people that were were in on drug crimes and um
but getting i mean well see i always have problems because because i can never decide whether or not i'm i'm supposed to be a conservative or or a liberal but
and it just you know it it dominated over all of them everybody all the uh raters loved it i like the i like the styling and i seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it
and so it's like completely opposed i don't know which do i like better i think i like the philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical
attacking a kid a child in a house i mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret the the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild
yeah i they really should've should've expected it and taken the precautions they didn't it's too bad it happened though
oh yeah yeah it's a lot of people like like saying that you know bands in that position you know sold out i think that's pretty much you know bull
awards up to more learned people and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous you know like millions and millions of dollars
uh let's just say a lumber manufacturing company and uh somebody is on the premises and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift and he pushes the wrong button and he drops a load of lumber on somebody and it injures them sure insurance should pay for that
you know the thing that they know maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that
we take several at home i take um and i take uh and also uh and
probably not uh we already knew we wanted to take one and we just started looking around
i used to take too and i liked that magazine but it was i was just found myself not ever getting around to reading it you get so many coming in and
it's uh a brand car but i've really liked it it it drives just wonderfully and there is it's so quiet you almost can't tell the engine is running
well i think they're they're having a lot of trouble right now i know my son goes to a private school but uh
did we did what do what do we think about a judge making the decision and i really don't agree with that
you you know what i mean
well i feel the other thing too uh they were saying uh you know what new ways could you could it you you know change the system
i really think that um we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal i mean if if you go to a trial by jury
well i know that's that's what i'm saying but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up
in in that regard i mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they i don't know how it works exactly but you know they get lesser sentences and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh
you you know what i'm saying that we we don't have um well a lot of states don't have capital punishment
you know all they they're caught dead to rights i just think that that's they've they've taken a life and if they should pay for it with their life
i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you
in other words you're saying that we you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were
yeah they sound familiar i probably saw parts of those you know a lot of times i'll watch i'll start watching a movie and i'm tired and it next thing you know it's it's especially if there's commercial in it
and you kind of get absorbed in it so the time goes by you know before you realize anything's going on
we do that too we have a uh a treadmill and uh a bicycle and that kind of stuff we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week you know yeah and we like movies
uh jeez let me think it i tell you i haven't read a book in a long time
and it i can't even really remember uh i think it was a romantic novel by or one of those you know yeah honestly um i don't do as much reading like i say as i would like to
it's if i'm really interested in what i'm reading i mean hours can go by and i i look up at the clock and say oh my word you know
i don't know what you would call it maybe i have a problem
you know kind of off the wall if someone says do you want to do this tonight uh and i got a mountain of things to do it's okay you know we do it
and i don't know and well you know with the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family
and uh i think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also i'm not saying they read all the right things but they do read uh where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all and i think it's important
well i know that it that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of uh you know helping them learn how to survive how to plant how to find water and i've seen so many uh
and you would think that more people would be better you know share more do more you know be more community oriented and all but if they just get more uh
i was going to say because i heard uh in fact i was talking to someone from uh just last weekend they was saying that uh in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for and she had gone overseas to
and she said they thought for a few seconds and they said uh no there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid
and she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in in and around
you know she had there are certain
and i don't know i attributed i think a lot of that to women working
and the thing is like i think a man can afford to support a woman
and don't they make a lot of um i'm trying to think what they call their soup i don't know
where women are like in the foreground uh in the background and the men are in the foreground and it's like you know um they live back in where where we came from two hundred years ago you know we've we've advanced beyond that
and i think that their uh mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing you know what i mean
i mean we educate them we feed them we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again
you you know it's it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living and i don't think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff
so i think that we we did come a long way in the sense that we have we're allowed to vote in you know like you say we're out in the labor force but i think we've lost something too
that's what i mean and and you know there's a lot of truth to that if you're not going to have a family then that's fine then you you know a career is is a smart choice and i think it's great
that's what i'm saying you know i i think it's great that women have a choice today
right that's that's what i mean it they'll feel like it's uh a job
and i wasn't there at supper time or bed time or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they'd be coming in the door i'd be going out
and i notice today's uh kids you know like we had apartments before we had homes
i i don't think if you unless you earn something and you've worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it because while i did this in uh you know no one gave it to me
and no one can tell anyone anything anything you know you're going to find out for yourself but i mean i don't think you should just not listen to advice even if you don't take it just listen
you know there's there's no harm in that whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid you know
well i i still think people have a choice i you know if you can live with it and it's not you know your conscience is clear
then i mean all all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not i don't know i mean no one's said for sure you know
well i think they're a necessary evil uh i wish the government would operate on the same premise that uh businesses operate on and that is uh
no i read for pleasure some also i read a book recently called have you seen that by
uh always trying to understand people better and understand myself in a relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because i'm in a people business
well i don't know if i have a favorite
so uh i guess uh i determine what the benefits are
uh yes so you said you retired i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning but anyway uh
when they realize that they get a part of the of the action based on their efforts not based on being sitting back saying well make me do it
see we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it i don't think anybody any i think most people want to be
um a little bit but um a lot of the um music i don't know about uh as far as the titles and i have to listen to it and and figure out what i'm listening to
the parents that are that are pushing their children at home even if they don't know what their children are learning they're they're saying do your homework let me see it
yeah i think what we've done is um um especially looking at um the area is that we're trying to bring the education
you know in the system we have a good pension plan um let me see we have a profit sharing plan to a degree
so right now i know what i'm getting from the state and um i have to balance more or less
you know when they answer the company i think it'll make it a lot easier and they'd run into less problems
i'm more or less if they told me i had to well then fine but if you know if they made me then i'd probably if i had my druthers i'd probably say well no you know just this
where uh like a lot of people are saying well i only smoked a joint last night i don't have any problems you know or something like that yeah
right anything with an a you know if you drink a lot of caffeine or yeah somebody was saying telling me if you drink it in you know an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test
i wouldn't want to have it disclosed because then i'd always wonder if they fired me you know why did you fire me
and you know his book brother is watching
but i can understand why they need it with all the you know train accidents and everything else
i mean i know so many of my friends i went to school with who are having babies right now and they finding some cases they're finding that it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in day care
hm well i'm just thanking heaven my husband just got a new job his last company he was only working four days a week so it's and he just got a new job he's getting lots of overtime he got a pay raise
yeah well i think we did i think we did learn some lessons that we weren't uh
uh i mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war i mean they you know they seemed like a valiant thing you knew you knew who was good you knew who was bad and it was a it was a traditional
uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one and i think you know she would she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff you know but he was actually the more
and you know so they used you know they used uh
oh i think they used the you probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself
and it's it's it's one uh i can't remember what they call it exactly but you you just stand them in front of the clock and you know it has a second hand that goes around
yeah so i agree that that should be encouraged you know people should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to
in so i think it the forty sixth in last twenty five years i think it's what they gave a run down that
yeah do you think that is um pretty accurate i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized or
well in um in um i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into
yeah and it was just they were showing like these dead people and they were showing people crying i mean just taking advantage of you know
they kept just showing you know how great we were doing and it never really showed what actually
a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the you know guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties and they kind of you know
if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know
and uh we have a my husband and i have a a aerobic video that's called i don't know if you've heard of it but it's a an aerobic video with
uh-huh yeah we know how that goes uh
i think so and i feel like you know like has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation and it does begin with the families at home
they are i have seen those those are darling
i don't know if i necessarily want to do furniture but mostly uh
oh good that's a good one i'd like to get um so i take it that you like to ski do you um do you um
but i don't know whether you need an a unanimous uh vote of not guilty to acquit
is that you know after initially finding out where people stand
yeah i'd read one book i think it was called by of all things that uh went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases
i really don't i mean i i like to refer to this as sort of phenomenon which is everybody that i know
well i mean there's there's a reasonable question as to
and most people think it is and i can i can you know accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it
and i think they're saying well if something's really important i'll at least find out that it happened
on top of the numbers and understand what's going on i know too many people who use a calculator if they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention
and uh and so well you know we we don't there's lots of things that we don't get told for good reason
but but regard to benefits you know most companies have most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing
and uh it's very much like the military it windows out you know you you think well boy i'm getting more money and i'm getting more responsibility i'm doing this but as you climb up that tree pretty soon you're the the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree
instead of wasting you know wasting my my you know the the trying to exist on the latency of my youth and the good health of my youth and it what i like to do is i like to stretch out
and uh you know i've got a you know i figured well it'll go away well i started you know i'm i've had to reduce my program reduce my program and i've gained fifteen pounds
and so uh you know it's you you know i need to get back into swimming you know instead instead of running if i can't swim or i can't run i should be able to swim
and uh you know i know that in i just know that i'm going to get blown away with some some piece of nonsense you you know some health related thing is going to blow me away that's same way i got too much weight on right now
but uh you know i need to i need to rededicate myself to uh to doing this and uh i got a problem uh you know ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it i mean i've been doing this for fifteen twenty years
uh you know just just a i think an over simplification i think there there the the there's so much criminal activity
when when when when it first uh you know when i first tuned in on that i you know it's one that's i think it was somebody was just just just ripping the hell out of someone another person and i and everybody was you know making noise in the background and then he was
yeah so i thought to myself i can't wait i'm going over to to in mid you know mid i'm going to um you know approach you know approach approach my
and i'm just trying to determine you know how you address and how you weigh you know getting getting the the hell beat out of him against you know forty deaths
yeah and and so i but i i suspect a number of them you know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in in the street
uh kind of an informal kind of situation we we you know put actually what happens is uh is my check gets automatically deposited i don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore it just gets deposited
have you uh you know ever thought you know just how much of that money should should go to other people that really don't deserve it
oh i i've got all four feet in a trough you know being a federal employee and and and so but but i can understand that uh that you know the uh who gets benefits like every every time there is a a bond issue
you know instead instead it's it's the taxes here so course i don't know whether i wanna go to or not
you know and i'm i'm five six years before i'm eligible to retire and and i'm saying well you know i really can't stay here uh as a retiree it's too expensive
and i and i and i'm saying to myself well you know you you dump your your your little turnip off to uh you know this child care place and they don't pay very much
and uh i think they're they're running out of uh you know the sanitary landfill i think uh is you know running out of course um you being from you've probably been in to especially if your your present location
you know they got i mean there there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you can you could use for landfill now
well what other uh well what uh what unique things you think uh that you can do about it in in what at uh other other than nuking it
right and but i think the i think semiautomatic weapons people say they use them because it for sport but i
if you're to say okay we have to get rid of them all because and you know they can only they only seem to do bad it it's um it's saying we're too
right well i think i mean we i grew up in a family and and my father had two guns because he used to hunt years ago but
stopped before really before i was old enough to remember but and i knew we had the guns in the house and the the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time
but we it was never my brothers and sisters nor i never i mean none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun or let's go get the gun out it was just something you knew was there and the it was your father's and you you that was not something you'd go and play played with at all
i don't know some people they tend they do something you know they shoot somebody or whatever they go to jail
it seems i mean it people move like out of the city because they want to get away from the crime and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out but you know it's only a matter of time before you know it still catches up with them you can't really run away from the problem
so it's it's really become i don't know really a mainstay i guess i can't even
last year and i did that all on a computer and it seems seems like i just can't imagine how people did it before it must have been just so much so much work
so um so you you you used uh your son's then uh do you do you find it do you like that stuff kind of computer
yeah i'd agree i think i think there's definitely been some changes um and i think you know the
there's there's not you know there you know if
i think i mean i thought
um-hum yeah i mean you know in in retrospect um was it was it or that said you know i'll i'll tell you right now i'm gonna raise taxes
that the would not in the right mind pass and realizing that they were gonna lose a the realizing that they were gonna lose a propaganda war you know by by you know slicing by by removing the tax cut
um-hum well yeah and what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well i'm gonna raise taxes
and cut the budget and we're gonna have you know we're we're gonna we're gonna have to do some unpopular things i mean he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected
um do you think i mean do you think our investment the investment in lives and money was worth it
i vaguely vaguely remember we um we had a we had a um spy ship torpedoed or something or like that
yeah one one one humorous one humorous retort i heard heard someone you know who claimed that you know was you know punishment was that then lesbians must be chosen people
um do you think we're do you mean do you think we're actually doing enough right now to
uh i think it's i think it stands a really interesting question of
yeah well they don't actually look as rough as the i just i don't know if you saw the tour posters for the when they last toured but i mean it looked like leather day at the geriatric
well don't you think that you know just having you know some
that i think you know if you were introduced
i mean like i think you know in the i mean i think we have been like ranked in like one of the top three for murders in the last few years
yeah i just don't i just don't understand these people you know that like when they they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know
you you you you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that you're a real danger to them and then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know
no i i think i i'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty six before i move up to although you know i do like the the graphical user environment yeah
i think i think you know it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from you know the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the you know actual students there
i mean do you find do you find crime in really bad i mean i live in also
i know i've i've come to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's gonna just just keeping your senses about you and you know trying not to look like a victim
yeah i think i've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun
yeah i've i've actually i've known known some people that have had their cars stolen
the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that there's a very large you know there there is a learning curve
uh i think i think there really is a there's a lot they need to learn you know when you get there
no you the the college uh their the catalogs are sales material it doesn't matter whether you know they're they're selling school and uh and true it uh really is helpful if a
um i think you know i think for a lot of people it really is the decision of
you know i guess uh when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to do some take care of themselves physically
and that's that's difficult part because i think what they get
um you know where they really required
yeah i think and i think it happens more in areas where it's uh
you know some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care but even you know here i guess we have
and uh what's ever left uh after that we you know we we sit down and agree on kind of what
really because you're you've you've sat down with a piece of paper and said well let's see what are we going to so what goes into that that particular thing it's vacations
well you know um also i've heard that uh the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home
outdoors so they wait while you're outsides outdoors they know the house is unlocked and then they just slip in
slip in slip out you know they know exactly what they're going for so i've heard that's really on the rise as far as um you know a new type of crime
yeah it helps to know your neighbors you know they give you you're supposed to make lists of um cars like i know a lot of my neighbors right around my development if i see a car that's
yeah you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go round until you i think the i think it's uh the average is eight to ten years to get it to the
i just i i don't know i think it's definitely time for a change but i don't see anybody i don't understand too why we have to have and and it's it's either one way or the other there's
well i don't know how much you can learn i'm not so sure i'm good at it but i do enjoy doing it yeah
well i hope it is there's not a whole lot of different kinds
yeah it's like you said it's you know to each his own i mean we're planning on having my wife stay home and but
give them all their shots and we saw an ad saying it was free so we went down there and picked it up and it's been an excellent dog but this is my first dog i've i've had
it's pretty good training i think i mean it it keeps us on our toes
for wood working um let me see table saw scroll saw band saw lathe routers and that's about it
i think what they need to do is they need to somehow
i think somehow you have to separate the revenues from
and uh i don't think um well there's not much i can do about it my my wife and i are uh in our forties you know so uh
so i understand how that worked and he was treated like he had five fathers or something
i don't think although i think a a more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me
but i'm not sure i could afford three i most certainly couldn't educate three i don't know how my my parents did it
i mean there were five of us i don't recall you know wanting anything in particular uh but i don't know how my father did it he worked at a truck line and
but uh i don't know whether i believe that they should just randomly do it
i think they should kind of warn them like you know well we're going to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired
yeah well i don't either i wouldn't even think about it i think anybody that does them are dumb dumb you know yeah really it's so stupid they you can you just watch it on and see how it just
i think they all should test really you know uh it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore
like i say maybe one of these days i'll get a job because i am looking still for a part-time job you know since my company went bankrupt and i'll see what they do you know but like i say i wouldn't care because i
i don't smoke i don't even smoke so they can test me all i want i wonder what if you take medicine if that would affect it
yeah find out what you know if you have been taking some kind of medication and you know if that would effect it and everything
yeah i don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen
yeah i know when i lived in it was just that uh like i definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of of the city by myself
so i don't know i just i just don't know what what they can do you know
um-hum well i'll tell you i think that is the most important thing i've uh i'm not working right at the moment but the company that i did work for
so but i don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs or
yeah that's what i was thinking too i really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that
but you know what's happening is the disability plan you know so many people are lying about their things there's been big articles in the paper about that
and um but i don't have any you know small children to have anything extra come up you know like uh running to the doctor or something like that with them
so i figure you know that's gonna help some
um-hum and i think if they want one they're going to get one you know
yeah i was just curious you know because uh i know at at the regular gun show you know gun shop that you that you do have to wait for pistols like a couple of weeks and then they check you out then they call you up and you have go pick it up
i don't know i think they should try to control it and everything you know but as far as just banning it completely there that's not going to happen
you know now when they have kids around you'd think that they would be locking them up or you know
well uh my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that and
but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family you know so he's got a second job
and that's you know the kids i know miss that you know
yeah you know and i don't know i i suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because
that's what my uh had told me that they were going to have kids
um i've been to some that's been terrible you know you see cockroaches crawling around and
i didn't think my coughing would come back
um on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in but that's unusual
but um it's really nice and they just they just do so many things for you you know to make you enjoy the trip and everything
uh-hum well i try to do it at night before i go to bed um it's really weird because i'll get down on the floor and i'll holler and tell my cat i'll say i'm going to do my exercises now
and she can be upstairs in the bedroom and i don't know she knows what i'm talking about you know pretty soon here she comes
you know i can tell when i do it and when i don't do it you know so you know it's got to be good for you
you know so i just been doing it i try to do it every night you know like i say it just i'd rather do that than watch television anyhow
you know so well i guess that's about all and i can tell you about my exercising i wish i knew how to swim but i don't so i don't go swimming
so i wished i i wished i did know how to do that if they had a pool here in i'd probably you know put my bathing suit on and go down there but they don't have a pool in this small city either
you know so i'll think of something just that that we can munch on over there you know
well what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody i think they should i know i had a job until let's see
right it really is and i think you know i think the the government should come up with some kind of a health plan or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high
yeah well i know the plan that i had with i could go to any doctor and i could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled you know then i just sent cards in and then
you know i don't know what they're gonna come up with but um
other than that that's the that's the way i use them i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got they can't they can't charge any more
yeah well i think it's better to use credit cards too like i say because you there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket
you know i don't know why they don't unless you have to spend a certain amount i don't know but i notice that some of them don't even look you know they just slide it in there and pass it back to you
my neighbor did it first and i seen her house and i saw how beautiful it looked so then i decided well i was gonna do it
so i'm just hoping that you know that we can get some cut out and painted you know before summer summer starts because we don't want to have garage sales or anything like that in the winter time you know
i do have the background i know what needs to be done and i know the the oil needs to should be changed regularly very regularly and all of the bearings and and and the lubrication lubrication system needs to keep be lubricated and
just to pack the bearings but what i found is that they had a brake job and they changed i had them another thing i let them do sometimes is that
i let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics that's free okay and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it see
exactly so i you know but i just did it anyway i like to stay i like to stay up on it you know like to stay kind of stay up on it then
one of our main problems was as well in i thought i was going to well it was a fun time but i thought gosh summer time you know well all it ever did was rain and thunderstorms and
you know like get your get his you know my brother brother and well maybe you know my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing and so the
you know and and we need you know better health insurance and you know cause
my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose but in the in the same token
yeah that's great you have what you might call knowledge power you know when when you work at a company
i know how you feel i'm uh i grew up in and and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know and
but uh i don't know i guess it keeps the shell makers in business
that's that's kind of a drawback i think but uh i don't know what do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits
yeah i don't know if you saw on the other night they uh they basically reviewed plan or toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing
i guess if i have uh my druthers i'd probably go for the i kind of like them
but i mean even now we've got i know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that
oh okay i was just thinking i wonder i wonder how how the civil system or the the court systems differ between there and say where i am in
that friend of mine's telling me that i might have to go in for uh as a witness he may subpoena me
yeah it's there are too many big problems you know there's there's such a backlog of court cases right now
i did follow that pretty religiously went out to the bars you know drank a beer watched the game sat a girl a good time that way
i don't know i i guess i'm one of those people that if i really made a concentrated effort i could really probably get into baseball
maybe it was i'm thinking about i know it was doggone cold up here um
yeah i can imagine what do you do for a living
but uh yeah i guess when i get back i'm going to school in actually um and fortunately i've been able to to play some golf on a student budget which is real helpful you know but
it's it's unfortunate you know you hear about i guess you know it's it's like
that's what i thought too until i saw the issue uh they've got all the well all the cars all the cars rated you know and uh
yeah that's ninety that's eighty six through ninety one but uh i don't know maybe maybe they're getting better maybe they're starting to get a clue uh
something that i find uncomfortable is you know you you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer
and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know let let's take the example of a modem for you know
i think uh do you live in a in a in a fairly rural part of the uh or
so that was the biggest problem i saw and i think that's one of the uh the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is you know do you have the room for this dog to run around or can you know i guess you can't really say for cats
sure you know teachers you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school
another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate or they aren't that sensitive like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they gonna do about that
um i'm sure they screen for just a particular few types although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for
yeah that's a good question i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail i believe they give you one more chance they probably give you a chance to explain yourself
oh that's fantastic yeah i used to uh kind of be that way myself when i lived in in northwestern in the panhandle i used to sail about everyday i'd work go to work
so it's like if if you use a lot of stuff you it's like well you know let's say if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink you know like a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend
right i guess from what i hear though uh next year is coming out with their electric cars they're actually coming out with the first prototypes in
right i hope i i'm hoping that comes along quick
uh i was reading a an article in the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going and i guess it's it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize and i know that's not due to uh
and that's not you know i don't think that's right but on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it i think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it
and it's really you know it's it gets to be a a really a big problem
you know because they figure well you know sure i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something um
i don't know i think that may solve a lot of that maybe not solve it but
i don't know it's it's an interesting issue there's like you say in there's been quite a few and and in in the last few years
it seems bizarre to me i don't quite understand it although i think probably the the worst thing that's happening in the world at least the modern world today is television
well i'll tell you television sure makes child rearing easy on you i mean the kids can be a real pest uh
uh but i read you know there's this sleep book have you ever seen that yet
i tell you i read that book to my kids so many times i almost have the thing memorized
i think the question is posed somewhat strangely because um
well i don't know what do you think
i think a train went by
but i know a train went by i don't know what the noise was but i think it probably was the the train
well i don't know i i i don't even know uh who who has been winning in uh as far as the uh and the but i think they both won their opener i sort of gathered that
sometimes uh it's a bit of a a problem you know because i guess i don't really manage my money the way i should but uh i suppose i've lost money on not taking good advantage of of uh investments but
and uh he has a teller card so he can uh do what he wishes do what he wishes with the money that i put in the bank but at least it isn't you know burning a hole in his pocket
which means well i suppose you could say well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation
and let me tell you uh i knew them personally uh not intimately but quite well and uh
uh well actually he i'm i'm sorry he uh was convicted uh and of course now you know and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process but
i suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone who's well educated to be able to to winnow the facts from the from the prejudice
oh i would imagine in uh you know in they have plenty happening in to cover that it gets hard covering all of the suburbs suburbs and
that's more readily available you know i think if we could send her someplace for the day
but i think it's an issue that you know with the graying of we're really going to have to as a as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this
oh i don't think so i think it's come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities but i still think in lots of job markets they're not treated as equals in the words in some in some respects the other direction that in some job markets they really don't wanna be treated as equals
i think was i look at the economic problems in the right now one of the things you wonder is what's that going to do to us
but i don't i mean at least i mean i think some nursing homes do that but i think a lot of nursing homes really
i think are you just trying to say that
and i think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that i guess uh maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who
oh so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of someone had to figure out what was going on
you should still be able to read you know which it sounds i mean it sounds like uh now i think maybe it just started changing in the past few years because uh
whatever again i don't watch news that much now if i had access to i would watch news more um i don't you know but i don't usually yeah
i'd be curious to know what you thought as to as to how like say news compared to the three networks
um you know whether you thought it was more or less biased or whatever but i guess you wouldn't you probably if you just watched it during that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much
i tried to get the baby to a babysitter to be good uh recommended person from the church and i knew her personally she have two kids of her own and everything but i quit my job because i couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child
you know i goes well okay so it's not like he's gonna infect her kids but then what happened was is i said uh he just threw up and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty so she said well she'll keep him home and he'll probably just sleep anyway
you know if if you really wanted a gun you could you could make one um
uh we have went a couple of times with him to gun shows you know they come through town and everything and i mean they just have i mean they have anything you'd want i mean you know you know uh you know anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and
yeah yeah yeah that's that's true um you know i had i had a friend who was a uh
you know he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that but i mean you know you're you know people make you know they forget or you know you know kids get in the way kids the way kids are you know i mean they can
not necessary or legal then i just refuse and i say what are you gonna do
any of these the public uh stations you know i think i sent in in money for
and they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that and they say oh we we know you you uh had uh contributed amount last year can you do better this year
and i don't know is okay but um i don't know when you read a lot of this stuff the the quality of the writing is definitely gone down in the last ten years or so but
but i don't know um i think if if you listen to like or something like
oh yeah the doing that yeah i know the i had uh
you know you uh think you call it plan deductibles are really high it's like fifteen hundred dollars
so the it you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis and ends up the best is they take a high deductible and and take a loss whatever whatever happens a be if you happen to be a healthy individual
yeah uh well i don't know i think other than health insurance i think uh you know an extra week of uh time off would be nice i only get two weeks
uh hearing a lot there's always they're always laying people off which is another benefit
ah i don't know we don't we haven't been doing layoffs we've been doing uh down sizing with uh getting rid of extra layers of management and uh i don't know what they do for those people
it you know and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information
but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the war when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on but a lot of the times
i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper but i just can't seem to find the time if they'd put it out in a video or on not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things
well a lot of that um i don't know how safe it is i guess um we keep it all in a safe here at the house
you know and when when we see something on sale um instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up you know kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill
i think the judge should hold the fifty or maybe even forty nine and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other
like a crooked judge do you know what i mean
and they were following him home in the car saw the whole thing happen
i don't really have this major budget or anything i just really i'm real thrifty i take care of you know two children and me and um just real careful with the money you know
no it's not hard i just keep it in a notebook and write down what i've made and um you know what it's gonna have to go for that month and
i mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go i mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to
you do too and i always check them off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because i always want to know exactly what i have
so um i think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks
one time i picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner came and just chewed me up one side and down the other you know he said you are gonna have every child in here wanting you to pick them up
and i said no this child was crying and needed some comfort you know what is your problem
you know getting love getting care they're just there
you know what i'm saying like i mean like they come on the stage and like you know you
you know and charge me twice as much the last time i took it into a repair shop the man told me i needed a master cylinder so i said okay
not a man not a repair man but just a friend and i was telling him that i just had a new master cylinder put on and he said looked at and he said that's not a new master cylinder
we took our to the dealership and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car
yeah and so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars we you know they told us we just had to have one and we bought one
you know willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning
i know what they're learning and if they're up i call and find out you know is she having problems does she need help with anything no she's doing fine okay you know um
they have no motivation from home so they just go to school and you know eh you know i'll get through the day and um bring homework home and there's nobody to to sit them down and say you're going to do this
um just you know they they take a notion to do it they do and um that doesn't work either you know they have to have guidance and um they can't just have it at school and then come home and there's nothing
and of course the cost of living keeps going up so my groceries are outrageous and i keep saying my check does less and less but
i don't know there's there's big bins out there i don't know if they ever get
homeless people seem i mean they all have like shopping carts and stuff and they'll go around and collect cans and aluminum stuff and so we used to just save them up and then they'd come around and we'd give them to them
but when during the winter time i think they they move south or something so
that's kind of a basic thing of economics i guess keep spending keep going into debt you're not going to payoff what you owe
so i guess the the question was more like uh do you get what you pay for you know get what you pay for
oh i don't i don't know i had a little bit more time to think about it i was thinking of like uh
i don't know i started i started to think about all the big
who knows how much you know
obligatory obligatory testing for everyone because i'm sure you know there's a huge part of the population not a huge part but a you know the the population i guess that have it that don't know they do
i don't know uh i don't know how exactly i feel about that
oh yeah that's they still already they're having like um in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then on on the you know and they've got like a countdown it's like sixteen hundred days or something
yeah i've i've i've heard some i mean i've heard statistics statistics statistics and things that
yeah if they'll let you work decrease your number of hours by any percentage just just about so if if you wanna get your masters and then i think of course you get like a with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due so
the only i think the i guess the only real um benefit i guess you could say working for me working here besides i mean
i have so i have to take that into consideration when i evaluate like how much i get paid relative you know because if i was working somewhere else i'd have to
i guess that i mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in
i think we need we definitely need more of it definitely
um well that's but that's why they should have started started doing stuff before i mean still you know since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people you know before the tests ever really came out who are who are draining a lot of money right now you know
really we're not doing much at all i mean most of what gets raised i mean it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by um
i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominated so far because it's you know it's bound to spread
you know try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not you know they don't they don't have to be just completely
i don't know i don't know what do you think about that subject
the recycling program here is just terrible i mean it's hard to find places to go i mean does a couple things they i don't think they do they do newspapers
i know it i know it it piles up
i just don't know and now they have like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because mean until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center you can't really unload all your stuff
yeah i think most people regard it as a warehouse
yeah i i think you know don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea
oh yeah absolutely i think um yeah i think you can blame it on social problems sure
but i don't really think those things happen happen too often because like like i said from what's reported in the news at least it's it's not all that common
well that's what i meant when i said the school
instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh
you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate
uh i know uh i believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books uh
uh i'm i'm pretty bad about procrastinating and one one of these days i am gonna do something about that but you know you know how that goes but uh uh if but she she handles it pretty well she uh
well uh say embezzlement right you get a guy down the street
i mean obviously you look at at technological the technological aspect of of social change i mean you didn't have uh you didn't have video games you didn't have home computers you didn't have machines
which is ridiculous and and the court found him competent um and he knew what he was doing and everything else i mean you know it was it was the best defense they could come up with
you know i mean there's there's no connection between the two
uh caught his interview last night with and it was the the first time i had you know heard um you know his views expressed by himself i had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in
to reject somebody just knowing that they have take drugs i mean suppose they found out some other way
an employer's rights as opposed to an individual's uh in addition to an individual's rights but an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to
so so you think uh i think a short work week is real nice uh i have a thirty seven hour work week how about you
generally i don't think they are uh my my personal opinion is that uh the politicians are out for their own good because they they're entrenched they don't ever have to go out and get a real job they just stay in their current job you know what i mean
i they they've never had a job i mean they've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes i know they pay taxes but they don't you know they they get paid a hundred and twenty five grand a year
which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and you know i'm going like i i don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than i am and they work less
and uh you know it it's a i think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that or is it the i don't remember but i think there's
turnover or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years i think there are i mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain
i don't know um i haven't it's been um well seventy nine since i was at school at high school and um
i don't know if i've seen things change enough that i can actually because i wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then so it's hard to compare you know what i mean
i don't know if i blame it on the school i think i think i blame it i think i blame it on a couple of different things i think i blame it on the school system
but they like to tell us that it's going to be important
i wonder if um if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because i mean so many people use it and even though just using is not really
yeah i think the appeal process takes too long
i think i i think it should take from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year
okay well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's rolling towards whatever it's rolling toward
and um i know that i was reading in the paper i believe yesterday that um
so you know there's there's a a big opportunity for us to explore uh what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment
yeah they're starting to to cut back especially start-ups i know here at we get uh
i mean everything from you know from to um to to um to feeding the homeless to um to you know feeding the homeless to uh maintaining prisons to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that
you know it's it's becoming a a large responsibility but someone someone has to pay for it and that's us
i'll like to know like where my tax dollars are going too i work hard to to get you know i like to know where it's going to
i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or uh don't live there or whatever
but uh mostly we just spent cash whatever we had and if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it but then as things improved you know once once i got them all through college
and that's that's the way i've operated ever since then it and you know if if something goes on sale and i don't have the money i still don't buy it
i i think uh i think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time
i think so yeah i think they're relatively respectful respectful yeah and and concerned that in as much as they can be i think sometimes you know i've noticed
learn learn what's normal for this person so it looks to me like maybe they're not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just you know is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need you know
yeah you walked in there and it didn't look like uh you know how you you walk into some rooms and there's it's completely generic there's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person and that's it
in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening in fact they'll have these little parties and people will just get i mean i've my brother lives near where i work and i have many a time called him to come get me you know and um
i guess i can i think it's got some relevance but i think its relevance is pretty limited i mean i think you know in your case i don't think that
unfortunately it still contributes to global warming cause you have to wipe you know wipe out forest to grow corn and things like that it doesn't make sense
interesting thing about gas is when i mean about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light you're not using energy any energy
oh my parents are in the same situation you know they their home is paid for but still their taxes are so high that you know my father doesn't feel like he can retire
i think it's i think if they put it into force more often they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got
was he murdered did they find out who killed him
yeah that appeals process i mean it's what you know really
i don't really know i don't really know they they started after we moved down here and so i i'm not really familiar i just know that and my in-laws up in up in that's how they do you know they pick it up but i don't know if they get a
oh i don't know what do you call it a dealer return type thing on a ninety two and ninety three or something like that you know year old ninety two or something like that
no but i my grandparents were looking into it before so i know what they've said
if they're equipped too to handle the kind of patients you're gonna have you know to put in there too because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still
they kind of liked me i looked and all that stuff and they i don't know what they saw in me but they saw it
i don't know at times i feel that a unanimous decision
i don't know if i'm making any sense or not
and also too i think i'm i'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more uh serious
i haven't had to it's uh the every so often i mean i'm almost pushing it myself maybe i'll buy a shirt from and it shrinks too much and say well i should have known better i mean i bought it from and it was probably made in by slaves
but uh they uh most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway i get pretty good stuff i think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized and if you want to buy it takes real extra work to find
or uh maybe they say well you we know you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade
uh need to worry about the they're getting like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with the floppy drive
you know if someone were studying something uh let's say take something obscure somebody was studying economics the could offer to send them to the for two years to teach them how to run their country
but in reality i think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use to for their own will and i just don't think it would work
i've been it it seemed dangerous i thought is the guy a closet fascist and then i find out that he helped rid the of the
well i'm in the computer biz too so i know he's well known in the industry they uh i have high hopes for him and i think that you know if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the government was actually for us then i'm for him
i mean in the primary i'm gonna vote for just because i kind of like and his attitude but when uh when it really comes down in the fall i think i know where it's gonna go
uh which is you know it's it still works fine but it's it's actually it's kind of annoying cause i've got no reason to to replace it but uh
yeah i can understand well would you want if you had to decide what would you want
i don't know what you think about all that
the downside of that is that you after you do one of those people say well we did it
you know which means at the moment um paying off the bill and keeping everything else under control
anyway i uh lot of lot of stuff interesting procedural things i think we could we could change if we're going to
so you know and i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on
they well i guess it depends on who you talk to i haven't talked to uh i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but i rather imagine there's there's some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic
no no i you know on on on one hand you on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's they they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy
out here named i don't know if this this got this got as much notoriety but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the problem um
oh i don't know just just nobody was buying it really
well i think it i think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there and i feel like
yeah i i understand you you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude um
i just don't know how how women do it particularly single parents who don't have the support at the other end
yeah you'd like to know what they're doing right
my son said that came home and he said he said mom all we do is work we hardly ever play and
i'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch and then they have naps or rest period
i guess after he you know gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care
i think the the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the the uh elderly uh person who's going in
and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort so it's involves a lot of spread sheet use
no i uh as a matter of fact we've never had a leak actually yet now this we just bought the house last year and um uh just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles so
but uh somehow or other that does manage to uh show these little cracks i don't know quite how that works maybe it isn't drywall
and uh he told me that there're a lot of uh lot of counts against the system which is basically the one people are talking about for here i don't understand the arguments exactly he says it restricts your choice
other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty
i think a little more honesty in campaigns would be more to the point if you knew what you were getting when you voted uh yeah
actually i think other countries may have it worse uh the government is always having a some kind of a scandal usually involving the or people very close to him it's so uh
and so we have quite a collection of those and you watch them at home and they have subtitles so you you figure out what's going on after a while and then you can enjoy it in the uh theater
it would uh you would know the whole world would know what you were facing
well you have to figure out what to buy or do you just buy along the same artist and
which means it's you know very difficult for someone you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full time
yeah and you know even there you have to watch out for you know you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there and you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry
right i think i've seen some statistics that say that uh it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life
uh sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if if if they're talking about reducing
um-hum i think that's been a positive development i think what that's done is it's it's it's helped keep inflation from
you know and she asked we were talking one day and and she asked me a couple of questions you know and she and and what she said that that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one
well i think in i think in the city they do but out here in the county you have to rent them
but it's going to a lot of the stuff that i mean all you do is to get guns
so does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten
well that's why i ended up giving it back to him i thought well you know
well see i had started saving newspapers and i have save a ton of them and uh that's i can't remember where i went to take them but they wouldn't they wouldn't take them
yeah i know i guess you run into the pollution factor
eat a lot see it's a lot harder for us because we're like i say we're spread out so they have to plan anywhere from six well really probably a year ahead of time so everyone can say um
do you i mean is that since you i mean do you have them every year
well yeah it it's it's pretty much what i was going to say is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in
yeah yeah in fact i know a guy who works at who used to work who i used to work with out here and he moved his family back east a few years ago to to take that position
and more more discipline and they have uh you know in in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say they can see that you know if i do something
it it seems pretty aggressive aggressive oriented i mean you you look at the last mission military action which was in the and wasn't anywhere near the
i think there's there's a a couple of levels of tests in terms of of uh
no and it and it and it has it has you know they they did that three or four years before they did it did with everybody and i um
uh have you have you done any jogging i tell you said you you did on the on the bike and on the treadmill in the in the uh clubs
i don't know where you'd where you'd draw the line anywhere else uh you know uh two thirds or three fourths or whatever but uh
well and and i'm i'd i'd i know it is i know it is where i where i work but i'm not sure that that's
although i've i've been lucky enough to never have any big problems but that that uh the cost is not a a big factor i want to i want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better
yeah yeah yeah now i'm uh uh you know i'd we'd when we moved to one of the reasons we chose it was for the uh for the schools and and realizing that that that
yeah i think i think so i think that will probably do it so
was doing a job in the neighborhood uh and and saw it and stopped in and asked if i didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty five bucks and i said fine and he had he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that and it
i took the it it left the it left he left the chips and i
other government agencies testing do you think our government agencies should test
uh i think the company still exists what they used to do is they used to
and uh you know i think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people
well in a sense that say how do you make a a conclusion that you're gonna lay off these ten people
right well i guess here we run into that sometime but i guess a lot of crimes are done with uh apartment type break-ins you know
taking women from the teller and and you know making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them also so it's kind of like a double assault there
okay well i think the court systems could stand some improvement uh
i i've known quite a few people that have um gone to retirement communities i don't know if they have them back there but
okay i guess it took so i guess recording has started now
right now we've got a in it and that seems to be just fine i know they said they're coming out with some now and i think that's probably a little overkill for this day and age
uh it it really uh i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because
uh ten percent or thirteen percent there would be no figuring i mean you would take your income tax you'd have a certain amount i mean you you take your total salary
you know we we planned out how much we're going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and
uh you're only you're not paying for two at the same time i guess what i'm saying
i just picked it up off the street and i knew what i was i knew what i was communicating but i didn't know what i was saying i never sat there and got a direct translation and
said something here when i came home and to somebody and he paled and said i'm not going to tell you what you said so
i don't know what i said to him but uh i didn't ask him either
putting the i think at each they had some recycling
right yeah it's i notice the plastics have sort of
do they budget at all i mean do you have them on an allowance or
um i always think it's humorous when when the gives the of the and uh for thirty minutes and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard
yeah i think people are people have that opinion they they wanna sit down in front of the and um or at a read a magazine or and read in four paragraphs
i can't really say recently but i think about um about a year ago um i bought
are very understanding and uh they usually get you know they they make things very they make sure make sure things are set properly if you're in any way dissatisfied with their merchandise
with the economy the way it is i guess there was a there was a story on the news tonight about how
i don't know what you drive now i mean what do you drive now
and uh it pretty much does everything i need it to i mean it it'll tow three thousand pounds so i can tow everything and it i can throw i've had eleven people in it before
went out and looked saw it was coming saw where it was coming from drove it right to the shop and left it off
i mean that's that's sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle it it's a i don't know people who buy motorcycles for transportation i think are kidding themselves
i know but i bet you he really enjoys riding it
but yeah i i mean the only thing i think i might get in a new car or not necessarily a new car but a another car um i would consider going to a a non
i think they i think the tend to last a little longer least until recently
you know i don't ask for more i mean i just try and make it on that because i think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have
and then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and plan some more and uh but i think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget
and then as the girls got older i think we we did more and more of that you know more budgeting as as they got older
well we just have yeah we have a good friend that's about to move to i guess we're not supposed to talk about those things i better get back to the subject but um budgeting i found you know i feel a lot better you know we used to work out of one checkbook
no i go by myself and and that's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me
oh yeah you can get really sore i know you i can mean i've talked to people but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore
yeah because it well i watch my husband swing and his swing you know when i compare to the pros is so it's ridged it's like he's trying so hard it's not that flowing movement you know
yeah because i think i was i think i read it in college or had to write it read it in high school or college but i don't remember it and then when had to read it at and i got her the i got her someone i think it was um
yeah well that's a neat thing to be involved in because i think our i think my alma mater um i think they were just starting a magazine
boy you really lift me up to a different i mean here i i'm dealing with uh cleaning the stove and you know i'm i wish i were dealing with that'd be nice but i
well i think capital punishment is supposed to be
and see i'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people
but i think if we would make a bigger investment in kids
and um actually because beforehand they told me they were going to uh do drug screening
yeah by the way when you say most people think it is i think it's like ninety nine point ninety nine think it is percent
but i would forget to write the things down and it it that i i don't know if i ever went as far as three months or not in in keeping that kind of data i certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever
i mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound you buy a a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars to me i realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that
yeah i don't know whether whether i would buy or not at this point i'm kind of
so it's uh i think they call it car jacking around here
um um-hum you know now i wonder what you think about this and uh unfortunately we we don't get to do it but uh it used to be a long time ago i guess in times when they had punishment
to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person
i guess i guess yeah and i would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either because uh
you're right that my civil rights had been violated but i meant for some when both parties agreed that yes we're going to have a judge here we're not going to have a jury you know let's get it over with sort of like car accidents you know
uh-huh uh-huh oh i know i tell i tell you what they they are they just um they're excellent uh excellent food i wish i could make them here at home
oh and and cheap too so yeah but but the kids you know they they've got those expensive tastes so uh they like so they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff
just recently i was kind of laughing when i when i heard the switchboard talking about the question because uh i had to have my uh radiator flushed
no i i i didn't do that thank goodness but um there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there you know left to do that but it cost me all kind of money you know to have that repaired after they said they were gonna they had repaired it t
you know to have the you know your car is fuming and everything it's already a hundred degrees you don't need that too oh shoot
um-hum um-hum yeah that's true i agree with you there so i don't know uh because i i need to have it tuned you know tuned up and i don't know replace some of the belts and i was looking at the uh
absolutely absolutely so yeah trying to you know i just need one i had two cars there for a while so i wouldn't have to worry about which car was gonna run
well yeah i guess um you know unless you're um you know big um to you know fix up your own cars and
and things like that so but i guess they they were talking about experiences you know i uh uh i did my parents live in so i i do know something about the you know the really cold weather
oh yes oh yes well i know especially when they grow up like that so i'm trying these these last five or six years i'm trying to make them really special and
and that was you know when you were talking about the the dishes uh some goulashes and things like that that's uh that's what i thought about was that rice dish
and um uh i think it was on uh i have to remember which channel but anyway uh we were watching that and it was talking about opera and they showed like what they thought an opera would be and one of the things was to kill the rabbit kill the rabbit
yep i know i know was was it actually based on a book
and it's all over him the poor thing you know so there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at
but we're uh we're getting more into it and we've done uh we've done quite a bit and uh uh the kids like to go out you know as often as they can um so that's good you know they're they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping
but every night they'll go home you know straight from work and they'll pack up and you know and then they'll leave and i'm just going you know by night i just want to crash you know and i want to go home and you know do all that and then uh get out on the road to boot so
yeah yeah oh i understand what your talking about
um-hum um-hum yeah so i don't know um you know it's asking about what kind of steps we can take um
yeah yeah you know i was uh going home the other day and i saw um a guy who who looked like he was breaking into a window and i thought gee whiz you know i don't know if he's really doing that or not or if he's the he's the person who lives there
uh you know and and i was thinking well i need to call the police when i get back home and because it was about oh about four or five blocks from where we live and uh and i thought no you know
what the the the door and uh and then you can have actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall you know to have it permanently attached and that's what i'm thinking i'm going to have to do because mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom and it's just
uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around so usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there's people coming around you know and they're trying to sell something or or they're from a religious organization
i know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you said well let me think
right right yeah i know i uh i do have a uh you know a computer at home but it's one that the company has loaned me and that that's been my situation is that uh that way i can get in access our um
uh i don't know it's music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays i think it's it's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music you know it's it's it's
it doesn't have to be good it's just who does it you know you hear a you hear a song and you and i think if somebody else were to play that
uh yeah generally or about the only new music i hear is somebody else that i know will buy something new that i haven't heard and i listen to it that way but
you know when you getting paid millions to do it you actually i think they take it to another level but i can see it's more you know
uh not really i don't think anything will ever take over the i think
yeah that's some brutal stuff there that's that's worse than football as far as violence i think golly those guys kill each other out there rugby something else
uh i don't know i don't know how my are gonna do this year so you the the are an up and down kind of team yeah i my my it's it's kind of odd my roommate that i live with here he's uh he's
oh close to a year ago now i guess i'd i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house
put all the interior walls up we just didn't do any of the wall work and that's it because you have you know get those joints to go together and
he had we'd gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it i don't know he well he did all the flooring himself he put the whole the whole floor in and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there and then we were put us like a
so uh but i i just like the i don't i don't know why i really got into them i read uh book his autobiography and
yeah you hear what you hear did you hear what he did he ramming his car wife's car and i was like yeah see that's just
well there's also the issue of uh out here i remember hearing a year or so ago that uh a lot of there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results you know or or i shouldn't say high i mean several percent
that's my understanding of the way um the way it works usually the the person ordering it doesn't pay but the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay
that's true is is a real a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh i forgot that there there is no well defined mechanism at all and and that it is a a a loss i think
i personally think i i have a problem with their viewpoint and i personally think that uh that there's a strong bias
uh pork barrel politics there there there has to be some way to do it i know state governors usually have line item vetos and uh
course there's a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things
i don't think they're very accurate because i mean i know their lifestyles changed prior prior to the drug test and i know they changed afterwards
see i always i thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more test
and it it's like it seems like now they have i guess they can test your hair and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago
i don't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly it is just
you know they want everybody educated no matter what it's costs uh and it it would be just
well i definitely think like decisions have to be unanimous
when i was uh couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and like you know you go say okay we can't bring up this point because then they're gonna you know the opposition will say this this and this and
to find out what was going on on that
i guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too like um
i guess that's how it gets passed on you know when one person you hear it from another person and then uh
because it was a kitten and you know they just they just love kittens they just are fascinated
you know that they must have just targeted that breed and said boy we're gonna
okay and so we could we could talk about uh that path you know how important you think his benefits are and and and uh how important you think they are and if what would you like to see increased
you know and i have uh i make my own pies and pie crust and you know i can make my pies from scratch i don't need a recipe to follow and
yeah you just know from heart i had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie and she said make me one and i made her one and when i when she gave me back the plate she said anybody
but for her own safety and for because she didn't know what she was doing
like it to take and uh i think we are progressing at a snail's pace but we are progressing
you know and i guess they were doing pretty good up to a point and then they kind of fell on their face
i guess he can i guess he can really call down a salary they're so astronomical i can't even imagine that kind of money you know it's just uh phenomenal
so uh when they chose baseball i mean i'm i'm i can understand baseball you know i don't understand football um you know uh it's such a rugged game that it uh
i understand that but i think they they happen more in football i think the odds are cut down you know i i know they can get hurt in baseball too
and uh one of the men that was in our league in on our league uh noticed uh you know uh my broken arm and the way my ball would do and he says let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage
i think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older to learn new skills and i think they really it really penetrates penetrates in your memory you know what to do because you really have a great interest in it
well that's not what i heard from one of somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about
uh-hum well i guess if you were having if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant it's a special occasion type thing yeah
yes she's she's little she's says how are you doing grandma today
yeah you're now i think everything everything is doing doing doing out of the house which can be very hectic
my my uh second grandson is an a cappella and i know what you're talking about when he's involved
you know the children are involved in that and he's been he has traveled and they have won awards so i know yes uh-huh and i know where you're coming from and it's it's very nice
i think if you look to the of
so i think the cockroach will evolve uh safely safely
i don't know if they offer classes in uh the uh in the grade school uh uh subjecting
well no i had a lawn service one year and i thought phooey i'm going to do it myself because i figured up the cost and i said huh-uh i can do it much
so i found you know and i've got some problems with uh two trees in my front yard and i took them to a certified uh nurseryman the other day and do you know what he told me i he needed to do
and he told me i needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he
yeah and they get that saw and i think it's a kind some kind of a screwing a screwing thing that just rips it right out
i think think it might be i've seen i think i've seen it around yes sir yeah
oh we we do enjoy that yes sir uh i don't know if we're particularly adventurous we find something we like uh like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good uh
and so uh we really want four or five bedroom house and uh you know everybody says you know how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing so we uh
seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about you know openness uh the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore you know
but uh you know they just they just folded it up and um um told him to that they took the top management and gave them jobs
so i guess you know i guess it works uh
well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far uh there was a company in that they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company
undo this now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion
because as i say there is a there's a tremendous well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator
uh because when you when diesel diesel is burned it's it you know diesel fuel is burned in a in a in the diesel engine it's burned so completely
no no learning i'm learning to i'm learning to be uh one who knows what's he's doing
so uh rather than being niggardly and and chintzy uh we've just said you bet boss seeing as how he was the one that uh enabled us to get the money to buy the
uh okay right or wrong i don't think is is we can determine whether we were right or wrong
yeah it was complicated and i don't think everybody knows the whole situation i don't
but from what i can gather is we went and said yeah we will help the uh
uh in fact i don't know if i could have uh held up uh you know without my wife uh helping in this this this case
because you know right because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time
i wish to he would go back
yeah settle down we know what we're wanting to to uh study and uh
shooting her uh with by firing or you know executing her by firing squad and uh the just said no this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really
and of course she had to walk you know they they stripped her of everything practically besides the the clothes on her back and uh so she so she went across the border to her husband and another and other child that they'd already had
but that's well both my husband and i work and sometimes i feel like you know by the time i pick them up and get them home and get them fed i have very little time each evening maybe thirty minutes max
i imagine and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them
i think that's true i can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment
well the way they have you know they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall or a lot of people aren't going to get up walk out of their offices and go there
you know where i used to work we had what we called tree boxes that's just what we called them
and when it filled up you called you know facilities whoever to come pick it up and they brought you another box so not only is it you know i think more people would take advantage of it and use it
you know of of the waste and you know i like to see you know you you drive through now and the bags are recycled paper and you know so you know i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it
well there's two i took my kids to see of course they wanted to see it they had the book and they thought that was wonderful and they loved the dogs and
but uh there's a lot i wanna see you know what i try to do when they come out is just make a list of them that look good so that when they come out on video you know i'd like to see i want to see uh i'd like to see of the
and see i've had somebody tell me that you know the movie is supposed to be really good i'd like to see that
so i'm going to have my went on the blitz about two weeks ago so i'm getting it fixed right now because they have their little movies their little you know movies they watch all the time and stuff and
so she just thinks the great in fact she told me if we have a little girl and she has red hair we're naming her now i'm not pregnant mind you but this is she's planning ahead for me yeah so
i haven't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis somebody will say oh did you hear about this that happened last week and it might be local and it might be national and i'm
so i guess i guess when i get to listen to the news it's it's probably television or radio i see very little paper but
i know how that goes and that's exactly what we've i mean i have to say i have been thankful for them because there were times when
we're uh i i've kind of got my fingers crossed crossed i've learned when you're in business for yourself that that you you don't count on something until it's happened you know but he's got some
and they should pay through next month and and we're both just looking at each other every night going man that'll pay off like both of our you know and you know just in one lump because that's the only way you can do it is to have a big chunk of money or it's like you say you pay forever
but then there's that side of me that says yeah but they've put on faces before
and never to this extent though you know so so it's like there is a struggle within me going do do i be open minded and give them the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality you know i i trust people i'll do that
but it's still you know i guess i keep that one part of me that's like well
now the difference is we don't i don't i don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe you know i think to that extent we don't go as far but i'm sure they lie
and i think it's moved in the right direction i now i think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight you know it's not going to it didn't happen here overnight and it didn't happen here without a struggle
and i think sometimes we forget that
well if i can pull a deal on this you know it will last me longer than that it will actually last me quite a while but i don't know how families afford two new car payments it's just it's outrageous
i know you can't find what you used to could find something for you know seventy five a hundred dollars a month it might not be brand new but it was a decent car and you just almost can't find that payment anymore
and we have had just wonderful luck with ours i mean it's we take it everywhere it it's been it's it's it's so easy to get the kids in and out see my car was also a two door
i wanted to stay home when i had kids well i have two i have a four year old and a three year old and we would like two more but i it's like we talked uh i don't want two more unless i can quit and stay home and take care of them which is something right now financially it takes both people to work
yeah you do there's saying course you know everything you give up something but i just i the kids are so wonderful but i do think that's one of the major changes you know my mom i remember her being home
you know and that was important to me an that's my you know my husband was raised uh his his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked and he's like well you know what's the big deal about being home for your kids
well see that was one of the things she the the question i think is you know what changes do we see and i'm i'm not sure i see it going anywhere i think they're still gonna have to work
you no i'm not and i would love you you you talked about having the summers off and i thought oh that would be so wonderful and i love the little preschool they are in it's wonderful you know so i feel good about them being there but it's still not the same
i think one of the thing that i notice a lot i know it's touching social changes but uh to me what becomes socially acceptable
i don't know i i've said several times to my husband that i feel like jeez in ten years they'll have just full nudity on and nobody'll think anything of it
you know kind of like disregard to others do what makes you happy and and yes we should take care of ourselves you know and we should see to our own lives but not to a total disregard of others
i don't know i think it's come to that a lot i see it a lot in my daughter i have a four year old and
i think when you push you know maybe i think when that was first trying come about with you know what we know as the women's lib movement i think it was too extreme um
i think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too you know and i think there's definite roles and i think you know part of the break up of the family
speak maybe maybe speak out i was gonna say come more out of themselves but speak out i think a lot of men were threatened by that i think now less men are you know because they're used to it it's around them um
i don't know why the families are breaking up i think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions because it's like
they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is gonna work they go in and say well hey you know
um i don't know what y'all are paying in but you know it seems like we pay the state you know there is a
yeah ours is seven point seven five almost eight and it drives me crazy i'm thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about
you just you just managed to escape the real accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there
and so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course that's when he said well you know you render unto what is you render unto what is and uh
after that i found another girl that had gone to church with us that you know they needed it financially she had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy and i thought well you know we'll try her but she came to our house and that just did not work
uh you know they were filthy when i'd get home now i understand kids go out and play and they get dirty but i mean filthy i'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair and the and i was like gosh and then
yeah well that's what they said there were two pretty near our house and they said well bring them in this week for a free day so i lined up someone they had a that my babysitter took them to you know which was fine they liked it they'd been going to it for years
like public they're not private you know they can't pray they can't talk about they can't do anything like that and i don't want them indoctrinated you know but i'd like them to be able to say gee made the flowers you know and things like that
lady at church it was like of that week and she said oh i found the most wonderful place that i've been taking my daughter and i've know this girl i went to college with her so i really i you i value her opinion
and so i went over there and i talked to the lady well they have like a three year waiting list but she said i had a mother tell me that she may take a job in and she has a three year old and a toddler which mine was at the time
and she said i should know something by tomorrow which is and she said if she leaves she said i'll let you have her spot
you know great i guess as long as i have to work i feel good that they're there they're getting the love the care have a little curriculum teach them
you know the alphabet the numbers the things which you know if they learn they learn they don't they don't i don't feel like i have to indoctrinate them by age three but it's kind of neat when they come home with it you know and
yeah well and it it you know but i understand i i i wish you could find a good because that would be good for your peace of mind also
yeah and that's usually like you know i don't know when mine were going to it was like from nine to three so that was a pretty good pretty good time you know my babysitter would take them and then pick them up
well i guess it said child care criteria and i think we both listed it and experiences
and you know i there's that sense of it you know you're kind of scared that risk of like gosh what could happen and then the thrill of you know the excitement of doing it
i think that's true because i think they saw the support that came through
he wants he wants them to uh uphold their end of the deal as far as the cease fire but at the same time he's not wanting to go in and say okay i'm gonna fight your war for you which which i think is is right
you know if it's an internal thing i don't think we can walk in and say gee i think you're right you're wrong you know we're not the judge and jury
you know if i know they tried to turn it into a holy war because to them that is what's honorable you know to to if you die in in a holy cause but but i think they're smart enough see there was nothing holy about it we just wanted their land and took it you know um
i would think so i would think that you know it i guess in the back of my mind i think like maybe the probably has ideas of going in and you know basically i i thought they uh
and then he has backed out he has pulled out and i realize they're still saying well here you're encouraging us to get rid of so why aren't you helping us and you see i think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another situation
but i think somewhere that got lost you know in the long term effects of the of the war and
you know i i i wish there weren't war
um i do remember when it was over i remember when they were coming home
i remember the feeling back then you know like i feel like right now i feel like this country has been behind this war
um and i and i recall when said that you know he said look he said i you know i'm sorry that you're opposed to the war there's a lot of us that are opposed to war but uh you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing and i remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that
it is you know an even back then i remember you could make something for you know half what it cost to buy and of course the quality was just exceptional
my problem i guess is time you know i i talk to my husband we kind of planning for the time eventually when you know maybe i can quit work while my kids because i my kids are young i have a three and a half and a two year old
and he says but i think you'll be so bored because you know all you've ever done is work and i said but there's so many things i want to do i'd like to start sewing again i'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch and these you know knit these things and i think that would be fascinating he kind of laughs
i mean do you think people really need two cars and
you know like i said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case
i mean i i'd hate to be the person to pull the switch you know i would never in a million years want that job but i do believe it's necessary and i on the one hand i i guess i admire the person who has the
um so i you know it's it's hard to i guess for me to justify what seems seems like you know basically a breach of the you know
oh yeah sure well it goes back to the again if you look at prohibition i mean because it's illegal it costs more if it was legal i mean face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce
oh yeah well that's why there's you know why there's people dealing it because there's money in it you know there's a ridiculous amounts of money in it
well yeah it goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people i mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen i don't think you can i mean
and i think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too because i mean usually you know you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless it's summer time you know and even if it's summer sometimes you get home so late that there's you know you can't do anything with them
having you know real problems i've found out i've worked for a few you know several thousand plus you know type companies
it's like being a painter or you know or something an artist it's like well jeez how do you really rate you know you know how would you tell if he was you know really good or so-so or whatever
yeah it's something i it's like uh i'm young and i should get started getting into shape i don't want to at one i mean one point it's going to be too late to do it like
uh financial benefits associated with having you know having people file fewer claims being sick
so it i've found that you know it's really important to me to get to read to i like to get away in a book you know
you know what i'm saying like that one where he goes to college
i don't know what what level or what how long it will take for you know our country to start
you know we're not gonna pay for this and you're out you know i think we're starting to see it a little bit now but i think uh
uh also one thing that's helpful and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever but most of all my family lives like in the same county so it's just kind of like get on the telephone and
uh they they my friends to get me they they say i hit worm burners because i i can't hit it up in the air so i'm pretty bad but i i i get great distance hitting it you know uh for it going across the ground
just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really you know checking the ground and and so forth you know see how it's going to break or whatever
i just i read the reason she got she they they killed her off was because they couldn't settle the contract and i said well if they're gonna do that to her i won't watch it and
from i don't know if you know her or not and then
nobody thought any different they just thought she was moving it was a moving man pulled right up to her house broke in and stole everything she owned
you know when it first happened it was he was guilty he was guilty he was guilty and you you you know they they they try to have you form opinions or whatever
and and then i didn't i didn't like the things uh the things that were going on when we had and stuff like that you know basically i think they don't present the
you you know so that's that's that's that's so i don't have a whole lot of faith in in you know the news of course it's they they get what they hear from but you know it's not always i think one hundred percent reliable
but you know i wish i had uh more news on things like that i consider long range things like science and medicine um
well you know it's it's one of those things i mean uh uh i would have to look at that if they did it with the uh
a lot of these repair places will say well i'll repair your for a hundred dollars
then he eats it he he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars now if he comes in and says you know i'll repair your your or somebody else's for a hundred dollars
gets in there maybe it's a blown fuse takes him two minutes he fixes it he still charges you that hundred dollars
you know where he says kill all the lawyers every now and then one is tempted to feel that way
but uh uh it was really frightening to think that uh it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway or for those people in the tollbooth uh i never thought about someone robbing those
and i think the drugs play a tremendous part in um the theft and the the violence that we see
it it is convenient isn't it i didn't know what i was doing
ah in a place like that particularly since i know how they feel about it
yes i do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for you know if you're faced with placing someone
her name was but she isn't alive anymore we had her for hm fifteen years i think my family did and just
and had never been in a building when i got him so he and he's he he must be part cross part with some kind of desert animal because he's very long and lanky but he's a very tame spoiled house cat you know now that i've had him for seven years
i know it they have all sorts of of rights that you know are questionable maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes
exactly exactly exactly because they get involved in things so young that they don't really realize what they're involved in
uh well i don't know i was watching on a movie on i don't know how true those can be but you know they one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them you know you won't have a record because you're under eighteen to steal cars and everything
so i guess if they had more of a deterrent if they had more severe punishments it might be but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial
to cover more area and i don't know if if gangs occur much down in do they
yeah the same in some of the areas around here but i've never had any personal you know i never met anybody that i knew had anything to do with it or seen anybody but uh
control what they're doing are older you know business you know trying to control whatever you know
it's true and the weapons my the weapons that people have are some people are more seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military i don't know where they get them
i don't know i don't know if i feel i don't feel real strongly about that if the um the thing is though i didn't think that even if it was a lower conviction i didn't think that you could
unless i guess if you request one you can but i think yeah making it unanimous sometimes might um
i know i don't think well i guess you really can't but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either
really i've never seen one in real life either so i don't have you know i don't know that much about it but i think it seems that we have a a pretty fair system compared to other countries i don't know how we could make it more fair i really don't
uh downstairs in the in the apartment i just used we just used a latex base and so you can drip it on you know if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean up
son his uncle whatever you know anyway he he has he recently retired and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke and and all the other children
and you know just you see a lot of things like you you know was always a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now
yeah and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever i don't know what they're gonna do it's really not my family it's my fiance's so i don't
i can't say much but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either and i wonder i'm gonna be the only
you know and i'm i that's fine with me my fiancee i both figure that's what's we're gonna end up with both of the parents or whoever if it you know what i mean we feel like it's our responsibility and i feel like i would never put them in a home
you know justice or whatever and most of the time i hear myself saying well you know we don't have enough room left in the jails and people crime is still climbing we need to have stiffer punishments you know but i just am scared of capital punishment i guess
and i guess they said you know should do you think it should be restricted i guess if it were if if because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment i guess violent crimes would be the
oh that's neat well do you have um uh i guess you're kind of young i was gonna say do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for
uh-huh uh-huh have have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress yeah i've i did make some clothes for one of those and
uh-huh and um to tell you the truth i think i'd rather just go to the island
would you now now i don't know if i'd like to go there just from the the problems
well i'm trying to think i i don't even know if i have any other real regular ones that i watch
but yeah uh oh i i was really trying to think i don't even know if there's any other shows that i watch real
you know i mean i'd i'd wind up um just a babysitter in a home
yeah i mean just they you know it's like the second phase and and so they've kind of changed the the codes a little bit and so that's kind of why i guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any and
no i i'm just about three months and um i don't think we really even wanna find out we like surprises so we'll take either
but uh we we don't have any real um like we don't really ski we haven't taken our kids skiing or anything course the baby's young but
yeah i think sometimes it seems to be but
but uh anyway i don't know i know there's a lot of plants here when i drive down you know along the just along the freeway there's a lot of plants that they're burning things and
jeez i don't i don't know what else i know cars
oh i don't know i haven't i haven't heard that i know uh i don't know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything but i know i think they they differ from state to state
don't dumps you know where you dump all your trash in the they uh yeah and i'm sure that does i know they're always churning that up and i i think they burn a lot there too i
oh well yeah i don't think i'd i'd like that you know we um when we've taken things to the dump just
the dump that is uh you know closest to us there's some houses around there and i know that on windy days you know they're always moving the the trash over to different spots and they've got those big bulldozers and you can see the dust
and that kind of yeah it's hard i think uh i find myself getting my little projects going and
i think if a people would learn to turn off the and i think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication
get back to the show some respect and course i guess the teacher used to warrant that but
i and especially i think with women increasingly working they're going to have to demand more from men because there's just impossible impossible to keep up on everything else
boy that sounds like uh course uh i don't know once you get it done then you probably won't have that problem again
you start with uh white and then they add the color you know what i'm saying but
yes that's what i needed and i didn't think about that i got a print is what i got and so a lot is wasted
so you'd know how i see i didn't even think to look for that and then the
or uh tried to say look you're holding your she's holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff she but she was
they have the right to uh you know i think i watched something last week um
to be able to find it i think it's uh probably listed in the restaurants you know
now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken that's one of my husband's pet peeves he doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak you know
to some point yeah you know so there's you know there's some things i think we can avoid we you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like you know this is not in my control
i think a lot of people are really you know searching now to find find out you know who they are and who is and what all that really means now
things are you going to consider you know what uh you said something about the about the
i guess the commercials are getting to me the commercials and i know that a lot of people i've i've known that have had have been just extremely happy with them that hardly had any problems at all
you know because then it would then it would make monetary sense to them you know to say hey you know if i just spend the time to to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then i don't have to pay for them hauling it off
and when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was buffalo i can't remember what they said his name was but he has a fetish for cookies
yeah i think i heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something you know
if they if they actually understood what they were trying to do you know like uh they want to to format a report a certain way
and i've known people that have used a package for for five years you know and i would say well have you you know you know more about this package than i do how do you left justify and they would say i don't know
and they would say how did you do that and i'm like well it's really easy and they were like well i never knew that and that obviously they'd never considered looking it up you know
i have uh the thing that that bothers me worse than the credit cards i think is uh you mentioned the gasoline credit card
think the i think the pinks there's like forty two different shades of pink
there's bit off a couple of large projects baby afghans and got one done and i think the other one's gonna the child is gonna be in high school before i get finished
she i gave it to her and she said how did you know those are the colors we used i said
you know and that that just drives me crazy because they're and then they want then you know to get it removed they say well you know you have to write this
so i called and i said uh i just wanted to let you know that the credit agency you're using is incorrectly reporting the information that you're providing to them
the credit bureau and say hey you know we're paying you good money to report this properly and you're not doing your job
i think that uh ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment i think the guy should have ninety days
because they found out later on that jeez you know a guy will lie rather than get killed and he'll say you know hey that guy did it you know not me
you know and they convicted this guy because somebody says well he looks like the right guy
and it's cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress i mean you when you have to have it you got to have it
and uh i came home from work one afternoon and our truck was packed everything we had was in boxes and my wife said uh we're moving
and i said where she said out to the trailer and i said oh no she said yep i said okay
well i thought i'd you know i'd use it as a a escapement type thing i don't know if you're familiar with that operation but what you do is you just build up the pressure
because uh well like i say we live away and when you throw trash away you throw it in my yard and i don't like that so i don't do that so i take it and i send and i mail it back to them
well sure but you know when you think about reasonableness now i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the the tort theory you know what tort theory is
i think he'll go nameless for the for the purposes of this conversation but i also know an uh who has stopped practicing
and you know he said i had to he had to earn gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice
editing a spreadsheet right now i'm trying to figure out how i can retire without having to work i'm ninety five
without having you know when they cut off a system and they don't just can everybody that's working on it like some companies i know of
i i don't know what you're talking about there
i'll tell you what we could do
but on the other hand i don't think it you know that someone that teaches uh say shop for instance should have to have a a degree at all
you know i went to college late on in life and i realize that hey you know it's nothing but four years of endurance and you might be teachable you know what i mean
it's my experience and and my knowledge that that is beneficial but then you know i like i said i came at it backwards
you know my supervisor has got really absolutely nothing to do with my job except make sure i get my check
and when i need something i tell my boss and he gets it for me because he knows that i know what i'm doing
feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are are okay you know well they can free them
you know we are what we teach
threaten my life told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death
and i just said to this kid i said you got two choices kid you can step into mainstream society or you can die
and one of the things that's in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to is the fact that while was becoming a great power financially
well i guess the best i can do is is uh compare apartments if i can compare the one that i have now with the one that i had the last time the one that i have now uh
but there's you know there there are a lot of buildings but it's just two stories
that's true i tell you what hit me the first year i was here uh eve in there used to be stores open the department stores wouldn't close uh
and then another shock i had well when i went to uh to buy a slice of pizza and found out that i had to buy the whole pie
i have a sister that can can uh crochet real well or or knit i i guess i mean knit and she knits things like hats and uh sweaters an you know
especially on you know i mean from the inside you know how you look under under something that you've made and it doesn't really
right well you know the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that i think we we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible that's
there's just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item and then they they just can't pay for it something something happens you know you hear so many stories listening to them like
um-hum well you know you you can do that i believe it costs about ten dollars
oh yeah it is it is you might even find somebody's been reporting on you and you didn't even know it you know you i mean you might think you're paying something on time or
it's it's i guess it's more like a a college campus also i mean there's hundreds you know hundreds of people work for
um when you know when they were coming up i i didn't sew but now i've i've learned how to sew so i'm well i'm i'm still learning how but i'm getting and i'm getting much better at it and i
and then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub and finally it dies down get just a little patter and then it
i don't know do we get a signal
i know someone that did that you leave a message and they'll they'll call you back
well i don't know if i've done it quite that much but uh
it had a whole lot of miles on it i i figured maybe i'd get one or two years out of it an i an i did get a couple of good years
and if you i guess if you keep trading changing them out you can keep a car for a long time
i just don't know how much they'll charge me to
i guess so but i just think they cost too much in the in the first place
recent generations i know exactly what you are talking about i mean i know several people who do not wish wish to work
so what i'm saying they they get the money anyway they can
bomb development and all this kind of stuff you know uh gosh i think you know we should have
yeah i think they they look at force as a way of
i don't know how much they'll stay to them you know if if even if we say that we're going to do stuff i don't know how they'll stick to that
i tend to agree with you you know i think they have in mind what they want to do and i think
i'm not acquainted with any you know i there's woods and things out in area you know there's a that's uh really a nice camping area
you know what i call mountains
areas you know they're not really cabins i wouldn't say i guess they could call them that but they're they're more just a screened in
uh i'll tell you i i watched what went on um with the show i don't know if you saw that a few days ago that that talked about nursing homes and
and uh from the time that we were tiny she said you know i want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home
so i know how she feels about it you know if i uh if i ever had to put her there i think uh it would be probably when i just could not handle it any more you know if i
i don't know if statistically they are but it seems like you sure hear a maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news i don't know
you know even there's there's an election or
and i think sometimes you know that's one thing that i have learned in working working in elections and things is you know sometimes even when you work for someone you don't really know what they're like
we use ours in we don't use them all the time but we use them like at time and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them
um that's what gets to be the really scary part you know if you think
you know you make this you pay ten percent if you make a hundred dollars you pay ten percent if you make a million dollars you pay ten percent
right so now you know when you sign your form or whatever whatever that is then they always say do you want a extra amount for state
and uh it's it's just ridiculous but i don't know i've they just came up with a twenty five percent increase on personal property in in county
but i i like that i love and and you know if i wanna get a fantasy and
i don't know if there's enough money that you could pay them just you know
or you'll hear thirty and think boy i've got my game together i've had a par and a birdie and a bogey and then you quadruple bogey
uh it was over crowded and the federal came in and said hey you know you have either got to build more prisons or let people go
and finally our governor at the time which who is not in office now came in and said okay where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let
well it should be given you know i i won't say sparingly but i do believe it should be befitting the crime
i thought it was you know and it had such a good story too did you see the end of it
and uh on used to be on nights now i can't figure out where they've moved it on our uh public television they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show
well there's very few that you know my life would stop if i didn't catch
well i hope y'all had as pretty a day today as we did
i know what i like and but i you know and i love to listen to it and i love to sing
and uh you know i don't even like the wind blowing on me so i don't know why i think i want one but i do
i don't know uh you think of and the good old
i don't know by the time i get home all i wanna do is just collapse or sit down at my computer and my fingers exercise more than anything now
i know a doctor once told me it it a friend of mine uh suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is
rather than to have them delivered and think oh i really need to read this
and looked at somebody says you know i think i liked that and then the more you got to thinking about it the more you thought you know i did like it
and it's a it's a mystery it was very predictable i mean you knew you knew when the murder was gonna happen or something but it was still so well done
well i think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like you know what what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood uh
well i don't know my brother lives down of us down there and i don't think they ate all that much different
i don't know if you do or not but we we don't a whole lot we're more once in a while but mostly family activities
so we kind of uh i guess when i think of social changes i think think more of uh
well they're so spread out i think has a lot to do with it
yeah i know my my daughter that lives in she has two little boys and they they've been in day care since you know one's four and one's one
puppy that somebody people drop things like that off up there and i said dog i told the kids her
nobody is going to you know reprimand them or know their secrets or
yeah the the cats my son has a cat and the vet had told us they get strange if they're kept in the house all the time and their cat uh was not a friendly cat it
uh-huh course they keep saying the weather's gonna change or we're gonna have more type weather up here so i don't know but for now
it i think you know you have to spend more money on your clothing and that because you do have to have the appearance a good appearance to do a good job
um-hum um-hum i know my daughter mostly i don't think she ever wears slacks slacks to work but i didn't know if the trend changes you know if uh
yeah but i look at homemaking as a job also uh being a homemaker and i think sometimes we lose sight of that
uh like i said my husband likes them and we have quite a few but we really get when when you get down to the nitty gritty there's probably three
the end of it you know i i think they should test more than once
it's to me it's not an invasion of privacy i think it's people have a right to know if if uh their their life maybe is in jeopardy or uh
yeah and it's you know it's it's destroying people's lives and i i think
uh-huh uh i can understand i know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them
if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger is that where it is i thought wow you know that's quite a deterrent
yeah so i guess you know we really we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about how great our country is
she said i always thought she'd change her mind you know but she didn't and there's nothing wrong with that you know if college isn't for everybody
but uh it it does make a difference in your pay wage income i think it's what they want out of life
it kept track of what they did and they would tell the parents what they did that day you know if they said anything or did anything so it kind of it
because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying you know if there was a problem they they would i think be more ready to tell you what it was
so uh i'll be able to keep that up a little bit but i think i think i'll enjoy
right that's right well they do say you enjoy them more uh somebody somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun they'd of had them first
that would mean they all would have to decide
that bad huh i wouldn't like it but i don't know if i'd go that far
yeah i don't know about the judge making the decision if that's do you think that's good you know like if a jury
make a recommendation do they sometimes make a recommendation that's what i was thinking they they sometimes do
um-hum i always thought it would be be hard to figure out what to eat if you were a vegetarian how how
yeah i think you're i think you're earlier than we are as a rule aren't you your your your summer growing summer starts a lot earlier than ours
we're supposed to have some rain this weekend but i don't know if we'll get it or not a lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us
uh-huh well that is great well i hope the weather stays real good for them and and uh that you have a good visit and everything and i hope your garden does good
they suggested that we uh discuss what we think of when we say camping
that type of thing and that didn't work but but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw which is why they couldn't sell it you know because the farmers would buy the straw if it's a you know similar price
and if they would all that's what that's what we want done is we want industry to take you know more responsibility in taking care of it
yeah and like i said i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because it's industry
if that water gets contaminated it will go on down into it will you know it it it affects so many people
okay now you can tell me what you do
yeah i know where my daughter works now she she course we live in a a rural sort of setting and where she works she has no benefits at all and her her wage is not
and uh it it's it's i don't know how they do it i really don't you know getting them there and then and going to work and then picking them up and all the preparations
i don't know i think those benefits you mentioned mentioned sometimes they're even more important than you the wage itself
so i guess our topic's going to be changes in the women's roles so it should be real interesting
i think all things get started sometimes in that manner
well i think now when both are working they have a more chance more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way
well our grass like i said is just grass we really didn't plant anything it's just so i suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even
if you want i don't know how that program works you know if you can do that
uh-huh i know where my son works they have uh an option
known anybody that you know works for somebody that they had that option
the other one is uh uh has you know needs more work done it's twenty years old i think and but they have two children too and they they bought what they could afford
i do too i've heard too many people say i hate it here you know they buy a place and they just hate the area you
max and uh if if i don't find something that i really want or really want to watch well then i just do not turn it on i would rather listen to music
sometimes they influence us and we don't know where that influence came from
absolutely i don't know who she thought she was but she just got to the point where you could might near you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice and that attitude being demonstrated
watch what they watched i was cautious i sat down with them and i watched it and if i did not like it i changed the channel for them you know i i you know i distracted them changed their interest
sure i can understand how that would happen
absolutely well i did i ran my kids to death i said hey i think that's enough television for awhile maybe we need to go outside
did something for example to an individual and caused them to lose the ability to earn a living i remember a man drove by
i think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is if if it is contradictory
i mean uh you know the guy is guilty you know he's done what he's done you you may have stood there and seen it but because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested
you know it's it's going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem and and i hope not lawyers
and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center and of course she was she had just gotten her degree and she was so enthusiastic and she was excited about it and she was going to accomplish all of these things
you know where do i go to sign up for the and he said mom don't do that to me please don't do that to me so i knew it was time to go back to work but i feel very good about spending those years with my boys
and i put them in this home the kids cried when i took them the kids cried when i could hear the kids crying when i went to pick them up they were always cranky and irritable
said he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water and told me i had to get my face wet or i'd never swim
and relay that to them and she said well she said you know kids do exaggerate but she said let's go ahead and send him another day
i don't generally charge i say well i will need a checkup in six months and i kind of set that aside and just pay for it i'm reimbursed on insurance anyway and i can handle you know paying for it and waiting two or three weeks
but i can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money and it just irks me i say my gosh i had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this and i've got three cards i've lost a whole day of my life
i say for crying out loud if i had the money to invest you know if i could do some investing you'd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card
do you know that i don't follow performers i don't follow actors some i know some i don't um
it sure was and you know the second time you see it you understand more subtleties in it there are a number of good movies like that
and that's the way i do it and i go quite frequently if you are going to be planning on doing that now i saw too which is supposed to be the story of a of a witch hunt that is you know magically shot into the present time
what did i say i said and he has done a really good job of characterizing
one is of the i've heard a lot about that one they say if you really want to be
um-hum and then uh and i think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie
i don't know uh i think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning whether he is or not and he he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time
i think that i would like to if i you know we all say if i could have the car i always wanted
good there's nothing wrong with that actually i think probably if i were going to get uh if i were going to be practical which doesn't mean i would be i would prefer white
but if i had the little read i guess the interior would have to be black leather and i'd have to live with that and if i got the it would have to have a real good sound system in it because i'd want that too
that's one of the and it makes you really concerned i am glad i raised guys you know let the world train them what to do
but specifically the woman's role in society has changed and you know medical medical reports tell us that women are developing
i really did meet a lot of pressures saying you know you need to get them into music lessons you need to get them into sports you need to get them into this they need to be busy and they need to be active
and i fought all of those things i said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me and they will say mom this is important to me i want to do it otherwise i will guard their ability to have quiet time
i said i sure will he said so i just won't vote i said then mine counts because you could cancel mine too
well of course of course listening to government the instructors you'll find out that everything matters but then you could go crazy worrying about everything
it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take that kind of action and that's completely unnecessary another particular case they were trying to
mud and muddier campaigns i mean it's just i think that eventually the you know the better people have the sensibilities and they vote on those people who are least likely to do damage unfortunately that's not always the way it should be
uh and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there and i'd be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now
well i think the terrain had a lot to do with the the success of as opposed to that in
um-hum well have we pretty well discussed the subject well i think so i enjoyed talking to you uh-huh bye-bye
membership in the clubs is expensive the equipment is very expensive requires special shoes requires special you know special equipment there's so many
as a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if i thought i'd be interested in golf i said i don't know i'll have to try it and see i've always watched it and he said well fine he said we'll just take you over to the course he lives near
uh-huh well it's easy to keep him occupied though on land i know that i took my kids we'd go out and i'd have them walk with me along the lakefront and we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell and
i don't care how much they take off of you you know you're still going to be above on top and i you know like you said i i've worked in different places and the ones that get the most pay do the least work
all the farmers you know well it's good for hay you know all the farmers got their first cut of hay and everything but they're going to need some more you know rain to get the second cut
oh i don't know but i hope it doesn't mean we're going to get an early winter
yes i would think someone older and i would want to know if they've had any past experience with children
yes well see when um i first got my babysitting my first babysitting job was pretty strange um this lady saw us at church and she was a you you know she was a younger lady she didn't really know my mom she knew my mom by name and that was it
uh there's no way i can't say that i would just ask someone you know that i didn't know like that to babysit
i um i don't know it was kind of it made you think a lot i think did you see
i mean i worked i did not you know goof around i worked it was just harder you know it was i do not know i was used to being you know on top and when i started there it was like you are mediocre so
yeah see well i screwed myself up also there was a point in time that i decided that i did not want to in school and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do and i said well i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life you know
and i thought oh my i am paying for this myself i am not switching completely because i will put myself a year behind so i switched to finance and i liked it better
they know exactly what they want to do
you know with sex you know your sex with you know
i don't care for the sound of the high notes so i asked him if i could play the bass clarinet and he said sure you know he didn't have anyone to play it so i played it and i really enjoyed it
yeah i guess i don't know either you know
oh it's you know really weird stuff he likes and i thought oh my gosh
um do you know any oh i was going to say do you know any other country singers that you would you know
you know and i think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any
so i don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting you know just gives in
that's just that's just it i don't understand you're supposed to you know go in if you have you know like if you've never heard of the people before or anything
yeah i agree i don't think it should be left up to the judge alone not only you know that they have to stay in there but hey how many times have you heard of judges being bought over
you know so it it's i think i think in in the end the judge has the presiding you know um vote i think he can be you know
i think it's just i don't i mean i think it's as fair as it can possibly get but i just think it's really hard you know i mean some cases go on for years you know
i just i don't know i guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail you know how they can make it more fair for them or not but then again maybe they should be there so that is fair
but although you know it wasn't them playing i notice like whenever i was playing softball and such
you know and i think she even gives mom and dad a little bit you know of rent money
so i had a policy you know my mom and dad got it set up you know you know helped me to get it and everything and i have my own policy and then i pay for my own life insurance too
i know the bigger cities have problems with it
uh i really don't know what we can do about it
i i don't i don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse
um i've heard of a few cases up here but i can't say that i've heard of uh you know any significant amount uh but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not
i don't i don't know what they can do
and i have had to take care of my own money i have my own checking account i pay for my own life insurance and i know a lot of kids that don't even know what i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor
i i don't think there's going to be many abortions but i don't know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion
i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics i definitely i think it'll definitely be freedom of choice
um i think industries and companies provide a lot of it
i don't know what they can do to really prevent it you know like how can what can they do about the oil burning over in what you know i mean they fine the the industries but
you know that doesn't seem to stop them there i don't know what else they can do
yeah i i yeah i just don't understand you know what else anyone can do about it i don't think it's something that people really think about either
you know it's i mean i it it should probably be a big issue you know because it's it's doing a lot of damage but i it's something you know i don't think many people really think about it because it's nothing they i don't think we really have too much control over it
i know i know they put things on their stacks you know to filter the smoke and do all kinds of things but i mean every now and then it breaks you know and and you just got smoke going out into the air for a day or two till you can get it fixed and stuff
i think um well i guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation i think your generation is um what do i say uh
well do you think that that maybe i mean uh i've heard different you know like um
um well i think the education like our education has um increased dramatically but then i think also that we're forgetting like basic things like we should know
from the morals and valleys um values of like per se your generation but i think as we get older it gets to your you know what i mean i think
i don't know because i know i don't watch while i'm up here at school i don't watch hardly any like night i like to sit down and watch a few shows but other than that
yeah well they're either hitting the books or something else i don't know what but i know oh well i guess they have their crowds like during the soap operas you know like in between classes or something
uh i don't know how i mean i never really watched that a lot of when i was younger but my parents really didn't allow us to watch that much so i don't know
and but i'm at school i'm in you know i live i live up at the college
yeah but um well even up here at school you know you it gets hot and we have the windows open well they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning and just to smell the grass it's just i just love the smell of freshly cut grass
oh see i haven't really been keeping up with them so i really don't know what he said what did he say about it
no huh-uh i've never seen anything out i never seen the great i've seen
i'm paying for my own education and i'm i come from a large family and we we we're never able to take vacations because there's there's twelve kids in my family
i don't know i hope they they do better they they during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better
yeah i think he is i think he was
oh you know and to me he does um oh he's just so big and fat he doesn't even look like he's in shape he's just so big no one can move him
uh-huh um now who would you say that you have a favorite i mean other than would you say that you have uh a favorite quarterback i mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the the attention you know
yeah um i didn't i don't know i i just think you know will get better and uh his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the you know so
i don't know i think i think it would be harder but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it
i think i think we've lost a lot of money and you know like we every never going to get it back it's impossible to get it back
but i think later on they're gonna start and forget about it and start making some of the riskier loans because i mean you're gonna have to take some risks
and as long as they're backed i think they're still gonna you know start taking on riskier loans and i think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until you know late you know in the future
well we buy things for the dorm whatever the dorm needs you know like we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things and then we buy like cooking equipment and stuff
or we play games like board games we buy board games you know it's just different things whatever you know would we vote on it and whatever the dorm would want that's what we buy
huh-uh i've never seen any you know places that do i know um you we reuse our grocery bags now we take them back you you know and use the ones that we have
and i was so surprised to hear how many people like whenever they're in you know the older people they're like um fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because they you know they wander the halls
but it's the cases you know like sometimes you you know you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely you know they really didn't do it well you know
you know what i'm saying like
like you know like i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for i'm not even sure of that but for some reason
yeah but you you think that i mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed
i don't know uh i was just going to say something i forgot what it was
so i most of the kids here i you know like you know just from dorm mates and stuff they'll say that they don't believe in it but then after i would say my point of view then they'll say well yeah you know you know
yeah you know i think people can be persuaded one way or another i've never seriously ran into someone i mean like other than my priest you know who definitely says you can't take a you know you can't take anyone's life um
i keep hearing about it i keep hearing the advertisements of it and and they keep saying you know oh it's wonderful it's wonderful i have not been over there and i was thinking you know it's supposed to be a family place
and you know they they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a in a decoration on the you know how they do the
and you know in order to survive in this area i think they have to be good because the ones that aren't so good don't just don't make it
i know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said oh there's no way you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week they were real upset but they weren't picking they were only picking up once a week and we said to them if you recycle
um because that it'll be that much easier for us you know like i said now we have to take it over to to it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked it up um
you threw this away you know he would get he would get all upset and i'd say it's just such an automatic reaction and now we think before we throw anything away i mean it's really funny we we really
and uh i thank every day that i have the resources that we have tapped into
and you know he'll say and then he would go to write it and he would write
and i kept saying to the teacher something is wrong here something is wrong here and the teacher kept saying oh he has a birthday he's just immature
she had picked it up yep she had already picked it up and she said you know we we were going to call you if you hadn't called us we think there's a learning disability and we think he needs to be tested immediately
because you know once the first report card comes in they have all these people being tested and she said i think we can get him real fast
have are more rounded you know sure sure i think it's real important to have friends i think it's real important to play sports i think it's real important to be part of a team
yeah yeah it's funny it's funny i was really i was really looking forward to summer thinking oh we are going to have some time off
the family has changed we you know we find ourselves doing things that we never did as kids
i do not know only time will tell whether it's better or worse than the way we grew up but uh it's it's just very different um
right right but is not that difficult to do when you are working full time and have to come home and prepare a meal and get homework done and you know where do you find the time
they were so destitute and i guess they they make all their money on tourism and and they would come up and ask you
certainly in favor of research and i think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does i think that
think that they should uh fund research and you know in the process neglect cancer research or whatever
but i you know drove a tractor helped them weed beets and that sort of thing
uh i don't know if i'll believe that or not but it it does seem up and uh
i think uh the thing that makes a lot of noise would would suffice i really do
uh we've goofed it up you know several times you'll hit the
wrong key not intentionally or something and and they call back pretty quickly so i guess it's you know i think it's all right but i to answer your question i think uh uh i think uh that is a pretty good deterrent in itself whether it
but i don't think there's anyplace used to years ago you thought well these little small cities and all wouldn't have that problem but they do
i agree with it i think uh i think a company should be able to test at any any employee anytime they see fit
yeah i think so too i agree with it uh i know company you know they started it couple of years ago
and uh if they say hey you can't do this work i'd say hey i agree i don't i won't do that and i think most of them have agreed to that now although they didn't like it at first
yeah it it it is i can see where you would think yeah that is belittling you know i'd probably feel the same way
but uh well i've enjoyed talking with you i don't know how long we're supposed to carry on a conversation do you
because they are i mean they got they've gotten complicated haven't they
i watch i try to watch the news and i read the newspaper and i like to read magazine magazine keep up what's going on in the world
and stay in touch with it know feel like i know what's going on now i have to say all three of my children none of them are too interested in current events
well you always wanna think everything can be improved upon i i really i understand what you're saying
well that's uh that's true i understand what you're saying and then again
so they hold their you take care of them they hold their value real well
i'd say well i'm gonna leave the boat out because uh we'll probably do this again tomorrow
and so many of those kind of people uh they got they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway so you know unless they really make it rough on them that's not a going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think
are you finding it tough trying to find what you want or
how how was the uh you say you say you lived in the area before how did that compare with this area as far as housing housing prices
this is not one of my better ones i guess i guess i notice it the most just uh in driving around with all the
oh i don't know i've lived here since seventy four and i don't i think i think they been working on the highways around here since i've been here and i think they'll i think they'll be working on them long after my wife and i are gone
i understand i sure hope so i tell you you know you get out on the uh interstate highways versus i travel quite a bit and traveling from like to to it's the same thing as far as the
a group you know headed up by would buy the and not really get behind them because i tell you we need a winner in this town looks like our are coming back but
there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system i think the i don't think the teachers get enough support quite honestly but uh
you could tell he's just bombed out on drugs and uh she sends him to the principal's office and the principal sends him right back or her right back and says hey your problem you take care of it
but i'll tell you what there's a there there are a few faults to say the least in the school systems today
i think you know the schools in the east are really a lot better than the schools in the south i don't care where you're from and they they i don't know if they learn more but they certainly uh
it's like your name must be on a list or something because i know at my office i get calls
yeah i understand they sell their you know they sell names because it's quite profitable to them
but it's uh you know i guess it uh you have to be a certain income holder to uh have an card so your name is valuable to i guess amount of solicitors calling
i'm fifty years old i've been a hacker i think i think i played better golf when i was fifteen i play right now
no i have a two through you know two through wedge i hit a two iron awful lot off now
well i travel a lot so you know uh this last one i leased so i don't know and i leased it on a twenty four month program it's the first time i've ever done that but i'll probably go back to buying them because i don't care to lease them
you bet you know where i've noticed it more i think is i'm a traveling salesperson and i have traveled most of my life and i know just especially in the last
trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject
but we had for years about five years i guess had a my son had a boa constrictor and
and he said i'll sell that snake to you for two fifty i said otherwise i'm gonna give it to this other man so he took the skunk too and the skunk was a good a decent pet but you know it does its little jobbies in the litter box and
it's just uh too much that snake used to watch our cat walk around i always told my wife i said you know what your friend's gonna get our cat one of these days
well it it certainly is and uh that would be a huge concern you know i don't think the general public really realizes this
i believe in capital punishment i mean you know a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone i mean you know if it's just downright outright
yeah i understand i'm a i own my own company i'm in the i'm a manufactures rep sales organization and my office is a small office and i'm very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt things like that
one day i got up and thought well i'll just go casual and do you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional
that's a very good point i'm from so i understand what you're saying there and there it's it's just a very good point
i think so too he wanted to go out a winner though i think he would've stayed there four or five more years so he could have gone out a winner
and i just i think he deserves a good break he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club and i think the owner i think with all he's invested he deserves a
a healthy team for one year and a good break also this thing with it just upset everyone i think fans owners management everyone
okay and this uh they said about magazines we i've probably personally take i think just two but that's because my takes every one they print and gives them to me a month later so
well we we tried for a while to take a news magazine we took and i think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and have it be digested but we've kind of discontinued that right now and we've we're gonna start taking that uh
every page i did the same thing i think i opened the other day or something and it was just nothing um-hum and i thought why buy this you know what's the point
and so he said well puppies just chew when they're nervous and well i wish you had told me you know and it was about eight months later he ate a piece of a linoleum he kept picking at it and i didn't know the the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it
and i told my husband i said you know it's either me or the dog and he looked at me like well you know so he loves this dog and every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him and he's a good dog
she's old isn't she oh i started to say then you broke your heart
and you know we call it going camping but we're really not but the one time that i did go camping when i was about i guess sixteen or seventeen with my family we drove
yeah yeah and we hiked we would hike all day and mom did the whole uh pork and beans and you know the slice slice the potatoes and fry them outside and all of the little stuff that we just were so amazed she knew how to do you know couldn't believe
well a lot of our friends in east will go to east in the summer and camp and i'm thinking how could you stand it you know just
so we've done that well um is there anything else you'd like to discuss about it i think we've i think it's come to a nice conclusion so i'll talk with you later thank you bye-bye
well i have a friend who's the same way and anything below sixty she's just not happy but i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in we really don't have as many seasons as the
yeah i think so too i know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains but it seems like here i would like it to rain and then be over and then not rain for a while it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern that's all it does
and put out yellow and bronze and they just gorgeous and so then last week my mom comes in town and she says well those are gonna die just the first frost
yeah we found them we dug under there about an inch and you could see them they're real fat old white things and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring
or the fall yeah because i started to say you can there's different times they say it's okay to do it
same way um-hum that that they warned me of that one finally and i said you know you need to either read book before you shop or get a reputable nursery
well put them in a salad though you say well i made it though at least it's mine
right and pearls and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school so uh she tells me i dress young but that's okay keeps me young
so i guess this is what you call a natural end
um-hum but we we just kept trying to figure it out until finally toward the end and we thought we were being very quiet this man turned around and said could you all please save that for later and i'm sorry so we're just not real big movie goers
well i understand i understand i understand
but do you sort of self budget even though i mean you wouldn't like on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that you kind of think this is got to straight you kind of divide it in fourths in a way don't you
to you know what i'm saying and so that that's the difference there where sometimes like i know if we've had an especially bad month and we're just almost getting down to payday
then i think if we could really budget we tried one time i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadn't had a car payment in five years
same here same here and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get you know yeah
well i was just trying to think when they called i didn't have as much time to prepare for this as i did some of the others um i love watching some of the um new new shows basically
yeah he's gone to get it thank you um but i was but i was trying to say on there's absolutely nothing and that's the day my husband wants to do straight sports
yeah it's real good and of course in the afternoons if i get in from work in time i watch some of those you know talk shows i like her okay
um i don't know if you follow much but uh um was in of the on you know you know whom i'm talking about
well i certainly am too now tell me what you expect from the this year
yes it does i'm sure it would it's such a monstrous place down there but um maybe next maybe they can do some i don't know who do they need to trade
well what do you think can be done about that i mean what can we do
no you tell me how you feel about
well i have a and i see most all of mine there what have you seen recently that you enjoyed
yes and we took uh i assume you all brought in food and everything
oh uh-huh uh-huh it's i know on we all elect now to chip in and we go get and bring out and uh but we kind of take our food for three days and uh
i think i do think now we have noticed a waning of interest and i think as as parents
oh i've seen it you know we saw it at the movies and then we've rented it several times and we just love it in fact we have a ten year old grandson that he and my husband and i we just sit there and cackle you know and just get hysterical
you're not seeing uh you know looking at you see them in management but you're not seeing them up there as and i have a sister that's an attorney in and i know the company that she was with
right i also think that uh uh women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be it used to be people would say do you work and
you'd say no i work in the home and it was it was then it was almost like a put down particularly particularly even by women in the work force
but i think now i think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very very important and it's getting the respect and which is about time
yeah it would probably make well it it doesn't make quite as much as you think but yeah spread out because you you keep the cream cheese kind of thin
oh i love to eat it but i don't like to make it it takes time and you have to rack your brain and time i don't have anymore
i'm sure you know if nothing else call the sanitation department say okay what are you doing reading you know
i would go certain hours and they knew and if i'd pop in unexpectedly i discovered you know they did a little bit they did better
we've had two and before that we had all and i think my husband wants another and we're trying to debate because our children are grown and and uh
i don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a pet you know another dog and we do have a very loving cat that's you know kind of our baby
he's you know right before the dog died we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side and the cat would sleep on my husband's side you know and when everybody turned we all four of us turned in a row
you know about putting him to sleep he was just you know he was getting so old and had that other problems too and and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier
oh i think i think the trends are going back to spending more time with families i think parents are definitely uh spending more and more time i don't think they're leaving them with babysitters uh you know
i think i think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was there for about uh i don't know eight or nine years
you know it is with huh withstood you know two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it all the time so and we like our neighborhood it it has has grown and the majority of the people you know keep up the neighborhood
you know right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs and everything so that's you know that keeps the prices down
oh yes wish our post office could do that
yeah i would like i'd like to see that i'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and and see what's going on even if you know there's no life up there or anything you know but who knows and i would like to see them do something like that
i think they i think they lose sight of of part of what they're supposed to be doing
you know let's go back to our original thing with you know the right experiments and our uh
you know how they fall away from it and the loading and then and then it's actually you know the smoke comes out like it's taking off it is really interesting
i don't like the government telling me who i can see and who i can't see
okay i uh i have grandchildren and i know uh one has gone to a well two of them have gone to preschool and i know what the experience my daughter has faced with that why don't you tell me what you have found
you know and i know that one of the day cares and it's a a well-known chain
and stuff and uh she was most unhappy with it there was no structure there was nothing to it you know and uh she pulled him out of that one and put him in a another one that was excellent it was it was like a little kindergarten
they had hot lunches and and they had classes that you know one class they'd do art they even familiarized the children with computers uh it was just it was really a very excellent one
oh i had uh i just assumed that most churches going by you know experience there that you know that they were good i didn't know that uh
he reads it cover to cover and uh if he thinks there's something that i need to know about he'll say you know here you need to read this and uh
but i find find that i do better with oh remembering it and everything if i watch uh
yes now my husband does that and you know and of course uh naturally you know and or but i don't know i know i see people leafing through them at the store
you know and if i want to drool or if i want to see how the other half is living
privacy yes yes i can see you know where that was i don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given you know when i have to cash a check
but i get catalogs from people i've never even heard of and i know they have to be coming from my charge cards you know
you know and i get i get tired of that i because i look at all that junk mail and i think of how inept our post office is and how that's taking up you know all their time to sort and they're not even paying full postage
well you know let's face it computers can be gotten into very easily if you if you really have the the
uh i don't wanna say not necessarily politically inclined but they're more apt to be in political offices now i think you know we've made great strides in that respect
was not as important a unit and i think now it's revolving back full circle i think the family unit is becoming much more important than it was
yeah we had uh i don't know my husband loves to uh
and he went by and he said whoops and he backed up and you know there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner you know and and i'm saying let's move right on
uh it was a it was car races some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down i don't know what channel he found that on
beds in it you know when we had that one and uh so we just you know we had our bedding we didn't have to go with sleeping bags but the when i was a
yes or one yes yes but i know that we you know as a teenager growing up and going to
and uh you know and it it always rained on us i don't care what weekend we went and when it was it always rained on us
it was it was more fun you know and as i said it just rained every time and then my folks had a cabin at one time at and we went up there but it was never quite the same thing you know
yes yeah even i would kind of like to go and i know if i go home and say oh let's go camping my husband says you're crazy i enjoyed talking to you too thank you bye-bye
what the answer is i know that it's scary and yet i hate the government constantly telling me what i can do and what i can't do
uh-huh yeah he really did i don't know why you know he didn't like at all he thought he thought was just horrible you know although we went to that did you go there
our son and just uh they got married last and they won a cruise and i know they didn't like it now we have several friends that uh have been on and just love them but and i like i don't know i think we would get bored on the boat all the time
yes you wonder what their you know how they manage to do that
that's where we go to get steaks they have a teriyaki steak there and when we have something to celebrate we head to they don't take reservations and you wind up waiting about an hour
my husband's taken us to work with him and we still don't know what he does so we just say he travels a lot so that kind of covers it
well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions it sure wouldn't have been decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home but she's accepted it real well now
realize how much i miss the fall i don't complain though because it was also thirty five degrees there yesterday morning and the high was only fifty and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon
we did that when we lived up in we went up to the upper peninsula and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure
um television shows sure that sounds good
except when i'm home sick and now when i watch them i think why did i ever watch those
watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like
i don't know sometimes they come on and and say
uh i even had to worry about but i think you know that
you know in a sense i don't i'm not i have real mixed feelings on that because it comes a bit from the angle that the uh
some of the down side and i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say you know back then there were the opium dens but the thing is if somebody ruined their life
but you know the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the uh in they seem to have mentality and drunk driving is a good one is that people are
well that was one where uh it's kind of like to me it's somewhat like the the story line um if you accept a few of the basic starting points i guess the rest falls in place
you know find himself and allow himself to get into that situation
i i guess i i hate to be too surprised in a movie and in that one you could you could pretty well guess where it was going to end up you weren't sure exactly
how it would get there but you knew where it would end up
well i think just most people have now and we probably watch twice as many movies at home
uh i look at our big green containers and i say well they work fine and i keep mine outside the garage
uh i don't know if where you grew up in your what you saw back uh years ago but for me the thing that strikes me is i uh
childhood and i'd say you know they were doing things then that we should be doing now and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're we're uh kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this
uh knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally uh composts or stores and uh
so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it and it will naturally decompose uh so you just have to kind of keep in separated and then uh who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into but it's
you know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and and i've seen people really fight it that desperately needed to make the change
for up to six months it's really neat i've i've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or they've you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint
so i i hope it helps it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time because that's hard
i suppose so let me push the button
um i guess i'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system
i suppose things some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening
uh i mean there there are things you could do uh we have signs up on the campus here speed limit twenty five miles per hour forty kilometers per hour
do do do you know where you are do the schools
yeah i mean i think my children learned the metric system but it doesn't get get emphasized over the other
okay well well i mean it's i would guess that in fact they don't test for for they don't routinely test for very many prescription drugs but that i but they don't tell you in advance uh so
uh i suspect they take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden
um but i thought i saw something about having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were
ah something i probably should do too i think i think government can do that now is that right
yeah i don't know i think it's gotten much worse the last few years
teach you trades you know beauticians whatever at more and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition
yes i'm thinking what what problems my children might have with that um but i agree with you
it it takes every penny they want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care and that's the sad part about it
you know we like you say we're used to finite things and something that's infinite is just incomprehensible
think you you know someone would make you sit down and write down what you know things that you've improved upon you probably wouldn't have a a pretty good list but you just don't think about them
that's great that's great i know we'd i'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things and i think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older
uh and it's uh i guess what they call a story and a half because it's not a full two story
well i'll tell you i used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on than i do now
yeah huh that's that's interesting though i you know i've been thinking of changing i've done the same routine for almost two years now and i'm thinking it of changing it up
uh i don't know about i think is pretty scattered
they come in and tell us have you just started doing this
well i love cheesecake i have never been i don't know the ones i have made i have not done that well with
do you well it is fun what little i do of course i don't you know i think when they refer to different kinds of fishing i told my husband last night when i called and they had told me that this was a topic
i said well i can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm he said i don't think that's the different kinds of fishing they're talking about
it was probably four inches in diameter or something something like that you know great big snake and it course it scared the women to death you know but the men come out and said oh well that's only a a king snake it won't really hurt you you know
um-hum well that's kind of we've never entered a tournament or anything we're not that big into fishing but i see a lot of people you know early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out and they'll say well there's a big bass tournament this weekend and all those people are here for the tournament you know
they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon you know they just feel they need their car
different worlds and how do you get to another world you know and i don't even know where they're talking about
yeah i know when our kids were growing up our we were big into water sports we had a boat and they all skied and in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing and
but they but you enjoy them i think the older mine get the more i enjoy them
and bring the kids and we play with the kids you know but uh we don't oh we go camp out they camp out and we spend weekends at the in the country with them quite a bit but
i hear mine saying well i remember mother and daddy used to take us to do so and so i need to take my boys to do this or that you know
um-hum they'll think it didn't mean them i guess everybody but me oh goodness
even it in the office i uh find that people walk up and and when you're on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy they'll stand there and listen to what you say until you hang up
and uh i just close it out i guess because i don't i don't remember waking up in several years at night when i'd hear a fire truck go by you know
so uh i have really been impressed i said i'll probably never be able to find another one that i can afford you know but i have loved this car better than anything i've ever driven because you you can go on the road and get there and you're not even tired
yeah well that's kind of what we've always been told you know they'll do it and then we hope for it and it never happens but it really it does get good gas mileage
they said you know you just have to press the switch he says i've pressed every switch in that car and i can't get the light off it's broken so they took it in and charged us the twenty five dollars and they called and told us though that all you have to do is turn the off switch and they showed us where the switch was
and so we thought you know there it was broken
that's right but it's really it's been an enjoyable car like i say i'll probably never be able to have another one because i think we bought it for about sixteen thousand you know and i said i'll never find another one for that price
and we have developed a tremendous number of friends that couples do this and you know it's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses
i hear a lot of the girls i work with uh constantly oh i wish i could find someplace i really felt good about you know
and it's really bad you know one of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place and then they called her one afternoon and said well we thought we'd better call and tell you before you got over here
and uh so you know what do you do
well uh i guess what i what i saw most recently and luckily i saw it only a week ago so i'd remember remember it well was um sort of light by comparison uh
that on the last one he said oh i never remember that answer and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers
yeah i think that we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or or what attracts us to a restaurant how do you usually find a a new restaurant
and also through coupons when a new restaurant opens up they usually send out coupons and you know when they say you know buy one get one free
it's hard to resist so we'll go in and very often we'll find a place that we like and we'll stick with it once they give they they no longer give coupons we'll we'll uh we'll stay there
i would probably like that one or two times in my life i've ever had venison i've loved it but you know just it's just not i don't know people who hunt so
well that sounds wonderful well i i guess i i would contemplate going on a cruise uh oh all circumstances permitting it
and uh i know exactly what you mean
huh i just have one son and he he lives uh out of the state now or rather in the eastern corner of it so i don't think he has time to fish either
so i don't mow grass or anything like that so i think if i had a big home and a big lawn i i don't believe i would enjoy it but just on the limited basis that i do it i do enjoy it very much
you you're so you're saying you you think the judge should actually have the final say
yes i know what you mean
that would be certainly nice shit let's say we we would have fifty percent of them law students at any rate yeah yeah
oh they saw the husband get
well that's not fair because i tell i can tell you one thing stay home sometime and start uh
in speaking they i don't know my mother feels uncomfortable around my sister and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there and i guess it's just because they're there all the time
the food they had to make it from scratch so to speak i mean you raised your own chickens and you killed your own hogs i suppose and then they they had to store the meat in uh
and that means they'll always have an advantage over us and uh they may even get worse because they know we have nothing to support myself now
and that's uh made from uh semolina i think they call it beans
that's great there was a question the question now to ask is it difficult to find time and you seem to be making out all right
well that's no that's exactly what i was gonna say if of of because i find now that i spend more time with my grandchildren in detail i know more about them and watch their growth
so it it's uh it's been helpful i mean yes having a budget is very very important and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and uh other major things were taken care of
i think i've i do that automatically myself i mean i unconsciously uh
oh they do eventually if they have if they're meant to i think
oh yeah you're really ready to learn finally finally i mean i don't know why i even went to college when i was seventeen it was a complete waste of money
we know what we can do oh
yeah well it it probably won't i don't i don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway we can't uh
i know sometimes i wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world and helping some countries i never even heard of
yeah i don't know uh i wonder if they really i don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize the all different accents there's just
course i think everybody in sounds a little bit funny but you you know how that goes oh
i guess because he is good looking i don't know oh i saw did you see that was a that's the last one i saw i think
right which most of them probably aren't i don't know what my kids see any more my kids are twenty and sixteen so they've probably seen about everything at this point
no um but i really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones but you know sometimes biographies i just read one about i love to read about
yeah i've heard heard that she's done real you know her books are really interesting and they always sell well
so i don't know how they expect them to uh pass
oh the and uh according to her plan so i guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn
i think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent and and you know how we're gonna bring that back together
i know how do we go into all these houses and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible
so now uh not that they may that may matter i don't know anymore i um fear for the from what i read you know i wonder how they're gonna get through the winter
and child labor right well i don't know what do you think has caused our horrible situation
i i guess we just it came on after something we used to watch
cheating when they have certain positions you know what i mean little bit little bitty positions and in your own home town and they'll cheat somehow or you know bend the rules use their power so maybe it's just man's inner nature
but um i think another you can tell when you go around cities you can smell specific things from from uh specific industries
i remember being i grew up in
i think you're right education is a big thing you know and as we educate them individually what they can do
you know i think that's changed just in the last generation just in the last little while because i know my doesn't do that much of that
i think there there are some things that women just
i think some different things could come from what's happened than what we expect
i can't figure out why they adored him
trying to think what else i like to serve
i don't know what you call it
you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs
excuse me go on and talk to daddy about it tell daddy i unplugged it for you but you don't need to drag it down the hall
i think the schools are having more and more problems because of uh things that
that uh i don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home you know and have a more solid uh foundation for the kids
yes yes and i think uh it's becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while i think
i don't know if they expected us to talk about blazers and such here but i sure never wear them
it's got to be tough but i mean uh uh i'm you sure you still have to you know let them know how you feel
well i'm blank i can see his face i mean how could you forget his face
we we have that here too but it's part of the inspection sticker you know they put a probe in your exhaust pipe and and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out and
and uh apparently it sort of feeds itself the more smoke is produced uh the you know after you get to like five hundred degrees
you know this is one of the big things with kids kids are writing letters to the newspapers about you know uh telling adults to clean up their act and
but uh it's uh you know such a grassroots idea that it it i think the family would have to be involved in it and and people would have to be convinced that
we had uh you you know all these we have all these uh uh somebody said you know you're either a stranger or a fool if you try to predict weather but
we had all these people saying it was gonna be the hottest summer ever you know and we had all this rain and it really is not a bad summer at all really cool but all of a sudden in in um in
yeah there you you know usually there's uh i have a a farm a hundred miles east of here in
yeah yeah it's getting real close to you know uh of course there's still a lot of work to be done and then when you get it completely you you know the shell finished uh you still have a lot of stuff to do inside
but um at you know our uh we we tend to think i think this especially big government tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it
and it's not gonna get any better don't i mean you know it just keeps going up and up and up
i think living in we're kind of spoiled because i think we get we come closer to getting our money's worth as far as the city is concerned
i guess for places i like to go i enjoy going to the beach and
so uh but you know i know the summers get hot but it certainly uh this humidity has just really hung on there
i can remember the first year i moved here and it didn't rain i moved here like in late and it didn't rain
new career but uh anyway so that kind of uh well i had been down here to visit so i finished school and said hey let's you know find a place that has a nice job and uh
well i think it's i think it's toward so it's
the hill on the sleds when it's icy i mean they just go down the ice yeah if it's cold we say okay out you go i think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there
right well no i haven't seen any so i i thought that it all had all been delayed several times so i have no idea what they look like and i'm
you know we when we go dump actually when we go dump our things oh we collect newspapers too and then take them seems like there's a pretty well there's a pretty pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics
so that's kind of encouraging i didn't know you know i didn't know if we started to do that i didn't know what to expect
right do you know i saw in yesterday i saw the return to the uh the small bottles
and i don't know if there's a deposit on those or not
i guess if i was having a dinner party i depending on the number of people i might cook a like a brisket or a roast or a maybe a chicken dish
i've heard you know i've heard a lot of people say
uh it the short cut on the cooking for lasagna they they've told me that they go to and buy a great big pan of lasagna
did you well i know people that have have served it and they say gosh if you have company coming
where you don't want to be always in the kitchen it's easy and she said it's they said it's good so that that's always sounds good to me um i feel like i feel like i'm in the kitchen cooking a lot
as a dip i thought gosh you know sometimes when we have it at home it it turns dark on the top so quickly so i just
yeah yeah so we bought that or we bought the the fillets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets and i don't think anybody in my house knows the difference unless you tell them so or in
yeah you know i guess i enjoy i enjoy jazz listening to jazz sometime although i don't feel like i have a good
and it makes it makes it nice it makes you know you can say classy or it makes an elegant wedding to have something else
and uh it kind of makes me listen a little closer to to the piano when i hear it at other places or when i you know see some see and hear someone playing i sort of watch their technique too and
well my husband's kind of the ethnic he he's the ethnic fan so he's i don't know you know what we read we read the uh magazine
oh oh yeah we i guess we we use the coupons too that's true that's true
gosh i guess just in i i like to go to
i guess if we go to into we like uh
well yeah well the weather's nice except for when it rains you know i mean in yeah i keep thinking about it but that doesn't that doesn't get it done i mostly jump rope more you know
well i saw a program on it recently and and it said everywhere time they cut you know like fifty five million dollars on a certain thing
well i think they should they should limit the to one term one six year term
now do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs
it doesn't even say it doesn't say here it says uh
and uh i guess i guess they don't they have they they uh have a lottery on it
they have a driving range and weight room and you know i think they even have a swimming pool and
i don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that
yeah well i don't know the working the working conditions you know if you could include that in benefits
so i i don't know you like you said i don't know how much how much they're taking from the work force you know
they have to watch out who comes in and and they're always finding drugs on you know on the most um innocent looking kind of
i forgot what they found but a dog found it the other day you know on on the border
you might put some like some yellow catfish in there i do not know if they'd live very well up in but
but they come up to the top and it is the best time to take pictures because they come up to the top and you can see their whiskers come through the water and
yeah and if you know when you when you have to look in their eyes and you know hit them in the head or whatever that's what you do with a catfish you know because you have to sever their spinal cord
uh not yet my brother went off the coast of uh when the i don't know what they that school out there it's he he said that it was just like that they were throwing like uh uh hell benders or uh
well the armed forces did so much to you know they did so much to their own people all during that time you know and they take they take a even now uh they take a free hand as far as medicine and
uh you know how they treat the war casualties you know if you come back and your leg's blown off you know or or it is hanging by a thread they still can't put it back together now but
well they are probably not doing very well at all because i know there's there's still people even in the area there are there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from uh
what is it oh really does even when you tell them no they keep calling back
you know but but i mean you know who cares about
you know and he has a chauffeur maybe he drinks but he never drives a car either you know it's not the same with
to uh to do figures and to to look at things you know see how they work
but we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes i know uh you probably heard about that uh last year
you know it's uh barometric pressure i believe is higher in the mountains and we catch we catch some winds you know a few winds coming off of them i think but uh let's see y'all just had a tornado
and the lightning was almost continuous just uh you know as if you put your hand on one of those electric uh things that causes lightning uh i think it was called the storm
um-hum oh yeah it it has a stereo and a cassette player and um it he's told me it gets forty two miles to gallon
well i think they waste what we pay
then you get a you get a child care exemption but it's not enough you know i mean you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care and and they only give you like
it was really and then and then uh really was a player i thought they made him up and then i found out you know after i saw the movie that they they started talking about that scandal and
well as you say it takes a while to build it up since we've had the crusher all summer we i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't taken oh i think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them to a
don't well we don't go out that much i guess well i guess we do go out without kids we're usually picking things up quickly though and just we just don't
well i think our i i never have liked to cook food but i think it all began eating out when we had uh the boys in in different uh
you know out of the question also i guess you can you know get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever all kinds i sub in the schools so i've you know had a
but you know i think they can test all they want for drugs you know and
if they need to do that as a condition for employment and i know many of them are doing it i know my son has had to do it for both and and i don't know how many others are
well maybe they run i don't know you know that's just guessing it maybe they run a lot of other tests or maybe it's under a health
i don't think we'll ever get to that uh no i don't think i think we're going the opposite direction it's the parochial schools that i guess many times they've had uniforms for years i really don't really know if they still do
well i think it does it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete
it so every day i'll have a newspaper at work and when i take a break i'll look at the newspaper but this week i've been so busy i didn't even bother to stop
uh i say that the oceans have the greatest resource resource of food on the planet and yet we haven't as human beings haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically so
you know i wanna i wanna throw some charcoal on the grill and and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that but um
i don't know let's see i have had well one time i did have a dinner party i served a uh uh
i got to watch what i say here i never know when the maybe uh listening on my phone right
well it's yeah it's it's primarily just uh like landscaping a little bit you know i've got some uh bushes around the foundation you know the foundation planting things like that and then there's some uh
well i don't know there was well whatever it was i couldn't there was a second there i couldn't even hear what you were saying but um
yeah because it like i think i've seen those before but i don't remember what they look like
i don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically but i'm really offended by the thought that i have to support uh just the existence of you know murder rapist whatever you know
here in it's a lot harder than that uh it takes uh it takes almost six months to get uh handgun permit in this state
and i know it there is it's very easy to get uh
well uh i uh yeah i don't know i think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless because i guess it's a pretty pretty rough thing to be uh electrocuted
i don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it but uh it's on the books which
and uh uh i can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though she's almost i mean she's that this young and she's almost housebroken
i think the stand they have or or the way the command respect i i support that i think that is a a positive thing for them after um
not just that this but different the different things it's amazing how the you know people you talk to have some interesting conversations and uh it's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base and that none of the ideas or thoughts are
oh yeah but you're talking incredible tuitions now i don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot very few i would imagine but uh
i get i just couldn't imagine i mean it's more money than i make in a year so you know it you know me being one person with a above the median
um and it's always a mystery because it actually doesn't matter who shows up it matters what instruments they brought because so many people switch instruments so often
yeah there's a lot but on any given night there's not seventy you know it it alternates quite a lot
yeah it's a similar thing i can't remember what they call it but the same type of thing um but we do get an awful lot of music you know we can borrow music from any of the area colleges
i guess my job change my husband's job change and it's just not easy to get up early in the morning any more so um
um-hum yeah i know well i know some people go during lunch but you know by the time i get over the gym and
hm well i'm i'm in proper in the city of and i know they do have you know a pilot program going on but it's not here
but um well there's there's a couple places unfortunately we can't find a place that'll take everything
and the library will take glass so we end up you know on the weekend we pack it all in the car and and as we go places we oh wait we can drop the glass off you know drop things off one at a time
so i don't i don't even know how high those go but some of those are pretty big
this is a whole block of homes that uh a builder built all of them and i guess he he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away
but the prices are much lower here and this was definitely not a fix up special but i'll tell you it takes all my time
but um what i found out once once i was declared an alternate and i was dismissed we met with the judge the two alternates did and uh he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy and i remember hearing about it it was about a year ago um
yeah although you know it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him you know he he has no concept of what he's done
and i the i was the i think the ninety eighth person they'd interviewed but you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt
and i said i can't imagine i said if i knew beyond a doubt or if i felt beyond a doubt that he had done it yeah i guess i could convict convict him but i can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something
yeah but but then you have to look at reality i mean i think you know normally they they may get out so
but what's it worth i don't know personally i don't know if which i would pick if i had a choice for myself that'd be interesting
which i hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and because like we have a dog and and you know he's gonna be out in the yard and who knows what he eats out there but we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway
so this year he got lazy so i said fine i'll put some on the bushes and that's about it that's all it it gets
hm but you knew when you moved in you'd have to pay that didn't you
yeah well i guess it wasn't a real good topic for us but well tell me is it snowing up there
i don't know i mean you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for
but you know if i had to make the choice again i yeah i'd i'm perfectly happy with what i decided um although we did just buy another car and that's a um but it's it's a used one
i'm sorry um hobbies let me see i don't know if that took or not i'll do it again
yeah i just have you know what they call community fish you know guppies and platies and and basic things i don't get into the expensive right right the expensive ones
and oh no all all the time and um i've and she's supposed to her variety it says they won't eat the babies and i've seen her do it
okay when they first said the subject my mind went kind of blank i thought gee i haven't taken anything back for a long time
i at first i thought of food you know because that's what mainly what i buy it seems like and uh you know i still don't have any anything to do there but
but it was interesting to i don't know if they're making them better or not i it's hard to say some i think they make more of their parts plastic which you know make things break easier but i think the technology's better
i guess you have to take some things and leave some things
that's true i wanted a little more detail like you know they would tell more about the people that were killed where they were from and how old they were and i guess you just you know you
you just want to know and with interest you know found some people that were members of our church which was different that that made you even feel a little more kin to to what was going on
why don't you go ahead and say what you feel and then i'll respond
yeah and i think it's been delayed i think it was originally scheduled for but the trucks that were supposed to do it there's been some problems with
from what i've read in you know the mail that we get and i can't wait for that that will be easy i get tired of newspaper littering the garage
yeah i hope they do something they need to or they're not going to have any esteem left at all
so yeah i don't know how close i'll follow them and and the season hasn't started yet i'm usually more at the end of the season person and we need to talk about baseball and so
it is it is and that's why i've i guess my mind went blank it's like last season was so long ago and i haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet so
yeah so the humidity i think is what does it
because i i noticed when i got here too because like i'd when it would snow in um i would just i mean we'd be freezing really cold and we'd have to get really warm and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing and you you don't
and also it doesn't seem like it does them any harm i mean sure their life is taken but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway so i think sometimes they'd prefer just to
so but i think that they do well well long time ago i can i remember my dad was telling me this i think that um
i don't know i've i've thought a lot about labor and delivery but i don't know
um like we i mean we've had those discussions you know about should we put her in or because she's pretty senile and
i don't know what they're called but they're like in he has little animals stuffed animals with him and like little cards and stuff i don't know exactly
um the last movie i saw was have you seen that yet
it's taken a long time to break away from from that but now that i've broken away from it i'm i'm glad i have
uh the uh acid rain and they'll they'll they may wake up you know how would you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of the acid rain
and uh i don't know exactly where it emerges from when it it's up in the ah northern sectors of that causes the acid rain
that's what we had intended to get in but we had a small yard and a pool and knowing how they love to dig and love the water um and we thought that was kind of a tough climate
so uh we ended up getting this and uh my son would rather have a though i think now he wants a
what they really are um they're really sweet dogs we've uh we thought probably our neighborhood in had more of this breed than any other place just because of um
well they range i'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper they run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars i think which i thought was a lot
know what she'd like to do
well i do think um i mean you've already mentioned several things i think uh just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there's a problem and more people are interested in uh
and his friend had already seen so many and i thought they decided on this and i thought well i want to see this one too so we uh i finally it's my first summer movie
well i don't i don't know if you got to see um that was out a couple of year's ago they had a free showing at the um
um because it's it's just a fun summer light comedy make your cheeks hurt laughing especially in the theater it was contagious you know i i imagine the way was but with everyone laughing
um i'm holding out for for the two of us because uh we had friends that went to see that and said you know it's just perfect for our age group and because i think he he needs a comedy too um
there's just not a time enough time to do it all and he said well realistically you know he knew he couldn't get them all in but uh really liked um
no okay because i i didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt um what what do you think about the proposal that all young should spend a year or two
my first when i first thought of it i thought it uh when they asked the question i thought well that sounds wonderful and then i wondered if people were unwilling but
but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i don't think it would stay negative very long um
i think it does help um even preschoolers you know they're um things even just starting around the home you know little ones can do a little bit to help the family
and i do think um the schools do try and do something even with food drives and um
you know right away what you want
oh i we just we it was and we had the uh we both enjoy mushroom soup and had told me they had the best mushroom soup and they did it was wonderful but um
you're just going to have to imagine what you would like as benefits
um we do have pension although i've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good and i know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that
after you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go is that all that's in there i don't think's it's going to pay too long when i get out
i'm not sure they only started to do the newspaper uh late last year just try like a trial basis and see how it goes so i don't know if they're going to pick up the other things
well we had the the one person who used to take things to the i think that's what that was called
uh to eliminate there's some parts of the company that we do uh government contracts and i think some of those require the drug testing but now thought well we'll just do it for all employees
it you know it can't be in your spouse's name so they will look i mean the testing will look for i guess any kind of drugs and you have to tell them what you're taking a prescription for
right yes yes when you get tested you're supposed to tell them you know everything that that the might be there
right you pretty much you know put down what you remember even if it is was just or something like that
and she got kind of fearful of being on her own she never really ate very well it was one thing she hardly ever took care of herself and she didn't eat she ate very poor so i think she was you know bad uh nutrition on top of it
um she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care uh then she got uh uh hip broken and then uh she wasn't as ambulatory so they were almost you know to the point of saying she can't be here anymore but
i remember from her checking around she ended up staying at the i think out in something like that
they're always saying that somebody's going to and some of them i think unconsciously do it you know as a just you know half senile
yeah i have a um my aunt's mother is uh gotten ill recently and uh she lives in they live in and they're saying hey we need you to be closer and
you have uh women like that i don't know to men it seems like the women out just out live their husbands but very reluctantly that whole i mean they don't get out of the house they don't socialize but it's my home and i don't want to leave it
but it's it's so lonely you know they can't get out and see anyone and i mean it's hard for for someone like me to understand that because i think i think what do you have there it's a house it's walls and it's furniture but
you know so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather it might rain on your little parade
well you know i i said i lived in uh the i didn't live in the city of i lived to the west of it uh
yeah yeah we used to have a time uh some of our relatives would come up from and i think most times we would have snow around and the kids when they were young would just go nuts
they said no really there's snow and there was but a very short time and the weather got warm so quick just melted it all away
and i just keep telling her how can you do that and i told her when she had her her little girl i said now you better get out of the habit of watching those you shouldn't be watching them with your little girl
i don't know and they they do have a variety of topics my first one was the toughest it was something like discuss pollution
say well i know it takes a fishing pole and some bait and some water
um there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it and so we didn't really know we weren't supposed to we thought dress code was just dress appropriate to your job we wore shorts we didn't know that was a big no no
well i've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the machine and they have said no
and we'd try we'd try to say didn't you bring any pants or anything we're we're out here in the warehouse
and it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just you know happen to be selected in our jury to understand what we're talking about
yeah you know some instances i don't you always have the option now in criminal i guess you always have a jury but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not
i don't feel that sure and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes you know the juries come down with a result and you go gee
uh they barred priors on this uh person and they never then told us i guess because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other
well i know but there are times when i sit there and i think wow you know we make amount of money and
i think i i impulse buy too much with them or i buy things you know i see it on sale and i think oh it's on sale i have to get it
and they say hey you know two thousand dollars you know free to you kind of thing you know all you got to do is go cash those things and you've got a short term loan
you know like when i first got my apartment and i was setting it up i did try to economize some but
you know you just have to have these things just you know have them at home have to have them at my own place and that's you know a big expenditure to start um
you know paid them all off and thought this is you know kind of nonsense so we don't uh have big balances on them at all now we're we're you know we i use it occasionally but i pay it right off we're
although at least doesn't have a state income tax yet i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe there'll be a day that they're going to uh enact this i think uh
yeah makes quite a bit of difference in your uh well your income level you know because other states take chunk quite a bit a chunk out for uh city and state taxes so you're uh looking at your yearly salary it makes quite a difference
i guess maybe if i was going to buy a car or something maybe i would consider where i was buying it to try to you know save a little bit on that sales tax because on a car that really matters kind of mounts up
yeah yeah that's true although i wish i wish you know overall they'd try the lottery again when did you first come to
oh okay but you know when we first came down here i really thought this place was somewhat backward i mean i was just shocked that we couldn't shop on
well the the uh there was other things too i mean i think it's taken us influence down here to get them to uh come to the the the you know the correct decade here and century um
certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the facility than um just letting it go in the ground because eventually you know it it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area
yes it's a heck of a lot different i mean we we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk we were about the only place in you know that had the gray metal desk people used to come and laugh and go gee i hadn't seen one of those in ten fifteen years
so or do i guess do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that so back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty i would
and the people that don't uh i don't know if you noticed if i wanna say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like i used to be in that research and i guess you are that we dress in the jeans and then there's kind of the
okay so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation but i think we we did it
and you don't think about the pain of it you you you take the time to relax some how and you think about other things during those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you can't breathe and this and that and that's no fun and it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people
yeah the exercise the uh weight lifting on the other hand is actually you know i think i look better
well maybe you know maybe not i'd say i'd say at twenty two you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting getting the exercise otherwise
yeah i guess if you care or if your wife your future wife uh gives you a reason to care which helps
i guess what you'd call it a project person yeah and i love i like i have a shop and
yes i understand my last car repair actually had to do with brakes and it's one i did not do myself i took the car my i have a seventy nine took it to be inspected
yeah yeah actually i i think it was a lot of money but i guess i don't like i said yeah but i it got to the point where i didn't know what was going on so that's right that's right
i do that actually that actually that was just um in in in beginning of and whenever i can i do try i actually actually i'd say this i i've gotten to the point where i don't change the oil anymore only because
so that you you in other words when someone built that software package they had to use the programming but if they were careful they could uh make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works
but i think you you you really hit the nail on the head for the average person is exactly what he can use it for and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending out letters or if you don't
oh that was awful and who knows still what happened really happened you know
oh i know now i told was gonna no we don't have that station either so uh i haven't been able to catch any of that but just what little we caught on the news
you know the the people that work in big business have families they have children so it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working and uh
and uh they enjoyed that but uh i missed that one my husband took the kids to see that one so
okay let me think if i have rented that one and how does the story line go
oh gosh you know it yeah we've heard about that one but we haven't seen that one either so well it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies then
yeah yeah i i know what you mean i when i used to golf out there i'd putt well but i i wouldn't uh chip well one of the two uh
uh well i guess it's a subject i haven't thought too much about uh i don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools uh as much as we're expecting too much out of them
i don't know maybe they should sit back and and kind of uh
uh well i guess social change takes in a a big category
i know they they did a it was on a talk show uh they took uh uh the parents and then the uh the son and they compared income
i know just uh just with me ten years ago i i was comparing uh i think i i was living better
okay yeah i i i don't think they they consider
i mean like i think i used to be more uh conservative and just your basic colors but now i i do like some of these uh
well i think like thinking back i think the only style i hope doesn't come back is bell bottoms
i guess when i look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms i say
ah sometimes when i hear what what they're even what even what the politicians are making you know when when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that ah
well i know anytime there's there's a big uh uh budget cut you know i work with the state and anytime there's there is a budget cut or crunches it's always the small guy that that gets hurt
yeah well i know they say like with they say no new taxes but they changed the ah deductions on you and that just raises your taxes you know they just get it a different way
well uh i know one thing i i think has the death penalty right
uh i don't know it's also just i've i've often pictured uh in my mind you know what it'd be like to just what would you find if you just kept on going kept on going
yeah i know it's i think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something and i i'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or something like that you know
and then i know with all that moisture a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems
well i don't know if i really have a a lot of uh requirements uh
but i still think i can i'm gonna get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it
yeah i uh i guess i hate to see anyone die uh but uh i guess these people that go around and and kill children and
well and and even even that i don't really know if that would help i think lot of these people do it
yeah well i think if they went according to uh the where it does say an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life uh you take a life you give yours
i think so i think so and a lot i think people are are used to now saying what's
yeah i think so i think women have come out more too on on like child abuse and and the the wife beatings and and like you said pro-choice and whatnot
and i've got a ten year old and you know he thought he knows about condoms and
you know and and they sit down and they look at you right in the face and they expect a truthful answer you can't get them give them the oh you know the answers and stuff they they that just does not
it really really does and it it has such a different sound to it anyway it's almost i don't know the way it vibrates it's kind of haunting you know on on some of the notes it it's i'd i like it
yeah well my my oldest is only nine so he he hasn't really gotten into um that yet they have choir that they go to you know music class that they go to but um
but i don't know he he shows he the only thing he's really shown interest in wanting to play is the drums cause his my my brother plays
and i told him he's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat
and i know they must think you know i wish those people would do something about their yard but my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that
toward the end of the summer you know when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing but by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops you know it's just it's a never ending cycle
i i think the judges do have that that better knowledge of it the only thing i worry about sometimes is if if you get somebody in there that that has a name that is the defendant and
right right well well also what i don't think is fair either is when you have like a say a rapist come in and and his attorney
and to me how can you how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of whether it be whether it pertains to the case or not somebody thinks it it had because they've got it there
yeah i was amazed at how many cans that we got uh because when the kids first went down i said that you know that's great and i was thinking you know maybe i'd help supplement it you know when they turned them in but
now i think your insurance covers her on that but you know for something like that
well i think you're right and i think would fit in and i think those things do make a difference and there are marquee players and i think i think and the and the have to be
i don't know for sure i just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in from what comes over the border from us
again i that's what i hear and and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there's a hole in the ozone or not but at last i heard it was
no and i think yeah and i think that that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth
i think uh we're gonna have to make some fundamental changes and and i'm i'm not sure
um go ahead tell me what you think do we get our money's worth
where the money goes and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and i don't think generally i think what's interesting is
i mean and i think it's gonna be real interesting to see and and then force upon them uh
an eight hundred number and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country they expect
and i've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to put create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government
like one eight hundred capitol or something like that you know you just a number you could call from anywhere anytime i think that's coming and i think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change until then
i think you know it's gonna be really painful so the question is how soon are we gonna start to get our money's worth and as you said it's how soon we get involved and i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look
well that's the good thing about what is happening because i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it is telling us more you know about the problems
so the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country
two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh
well it's gonna make it tough for them and it's it's gonna be a difficult transition i don't know uh how it's gonna uh
yeah i showed you that one too didn't i the brown one yeah the one that looks like a fudgesicle
well i've heard now i asked somebody recently about how how you do that
oh um well i don't i don't especially recommend i mean you have you have to just sort of like this though you have to like did you see
quite a random crew of of characters um it would've made you know these movies look normal
uh you know if i only looked at one of them i would have a different perspective clearly would have a different perspective on the world
but there are a whole lot of you know i mean i would recommend you look at that book if you're if you are a busy person
would would you mean if you could legislate something what would you legislate
well i think these people are hired by from from different sources
and you don't know where it's gonna end uh
no i've i've heard they're i hear you have some problems
right so so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists i mean right now lobbyists require to register you'd just say
i mean good that i have done good because it's it seems right and good because it has good effects but but it's this maintaining a a regular habit that i just can't seem to do
by by by saying well this doing this this particular crime in this particular way is a capital crime now
i see so so if if had been found guilty you believe he should have been uh executed
and uh you know i i wondered if i would have to be certified or whether they'd just bring them and and we got to where well we were just friends and so they said no don't do that we'll just bring them
like does her own bread and does her own stuff and so when she um does food she really goes all out and i don't know how she can do it and be calm
then they'll turn a little bit gray you can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray and they will be a little harder and i don't like that
so you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in if you have a microwave book but uh you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a
yeah an and that turns out okay and it's funny because if i turn them out on to a dish on to like a plate for them to take what they want
that's okay they say when you're done you're done so yeah i you don't have to wait for them to say you're cut off your time you just say have a good day or whatever you say you too
think about things like that too i have given seminars before in in creative writing and things like that now i don't know if they consider that a job i don't really get paid for that
i don't know what it would take to to get my children to start working on it i
i don't know why that is i don't know if it's looking at the little things little things every time
and that's not it's really not too difficult you could learn that i'm sure and pick that up if you i think if you can do any handicraft you can learn to crochet it's not too difficult
huh and yet you know i think about you know you said you do a lot of needlework and and there are some beautiful just gorgeous patterns
yeah that's true you know and and i always think well i can do this while i watch or something you know
and so this was one and they um planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and and had you know things like that have to be planned like they had planned that
like what is traditionally taught you know you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano
i don't know if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it
right right and it gives me time to think so i think not only does it help my body but i think it helps my mind too uh so i like that
now some of the ones that have just received the awards this year i haven't read and i would like to read those
um-hum i hope so you know it's i think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice
and like you said um one women today have so many uh the average today of having a a single family you know with the mother as the head is just really um
you know the ones who have dogs are very uh protective of them and i think that's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets but they just um
and they've been looking and looking and want you know they'd take anything i think but um i don't know do you like i guess your cat was an indoor cat
yeah language too and language and violence and sexual you you know things i i get kind of uh saying is and i i think it is important that i see
yeah my wife took the uh i think the kids to see that one but
well i know what uh i took my kids out and taught them how to shoot a gun gun my wife the same thing uh she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not not that i have an arsenal or anything but we have several guns around the house
they'd just stack up i wouldn't find time to read them you have to have time to sit down and concentrate on on the stories or else all of a sudden you look and there's three uh three weeks worth laying on the coffee table
i know uh my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think
so and doing all these studies and the things we saw about them traveling to to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something that
um another thing i thought of i guess to recycle would be like clothes because i mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other
and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think it's twenty four hours you can report it in
and i he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had and and if whoever tried to uh you know credit it to the hilt
yeah they give you i think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesn't sound like a thing but when you you know when you add up everything you've you've charged up on the card for a year
yeah i at first i it took eight times to find you you so i told my husband um you know what should i say and then he reminded me but um
yeah i see what you're saying yeah i totally agree
yeah and i mean like you said how they were the schools were doing more things for the kids
the reason i ask if you went to college is i thought well you know what were your selection criteria did you base it
so that's how you know my decision was made but um
well i take it since you selected this topic that you have children
you you learn a lot by going in there and they explain they explain to you you know what their day consists of and what their general rules are and um
um i think lots of people lot i think i went by location for one thing i think most people do that i think you start out with the criteria of
oh i well actually i would you know what i would love i would absolutely love a sail boat that doesn't go along with camping but now that that that's what i would like to have
you're pretty yes but you know you know what's really funny um i've had people tell me that i have a accent and i mean there just is no way i've not picked one up
you know where you should try sometime is it is beautiful absolutely beautiful
you know i'm just a chicken i know lots of women would do it all the time but i haven't i haven't quite adjusted you know
i think i've had about four yeah yeah yeah it's well you know when i had to set huh this is my my nature you know it's like what are you interested in and it's like virtually anything i'll talk about anything with anybody
i wish i did i i hope you're you're a person who does things better than i don't have a budget that's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good
the scary thing is as far as long term i don't have anything i don't know if you have an or uh you know and i've got two girls also and i haven't saved anything for their college and
thank you i think we might have just screwed up the computer but we'll find out
i don't read as much as i would like to either i'm i'm a single mom but i i've always loved reading what do you like to read
oh i would imagine helping them feel good about themselves they're at a bad stage anyway and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible as a teen
i think so too oh well thank you for calling and uh i'll have to check out that book you told me about okay thank you you take care bye-bye
i also agree that i mean if there's somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough
you understand what i'm saying i i'm
but they can't just walk out of prison and do that they can't just walk out of prison and say okay i'm going to go a different route
we have to just report what's happening we can't say well this is what i think about you know the situation sometimes
you really want to say that you really want to say what you think or what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone or you know
exactly know what they mean and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents but it's
but there wasn't a it was strange it was kind of sad there wasn't ever a language problem there because everyone in knew and everyone in knew
do they always have the the one person in the family who knows or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best and that's what they get to cook
that all it's a home centered you know it's all family centered anyway so you usually are living where your parents live and it's all your you don't have to come home so the would make a pilgrimage in older
so i think that's what they did at first was that they had metric and and i mean and there's things that we've gone metric we have metric
so that you know so that we have little things that are metric but no one
you know get that in our minds so that we could change i mean because i think our generation could make a change
i felt real competitive there and i need to find some place i could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are
well i saw um lately i've seen which was a uh that was a lot of fun it was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things
yeah but i wonder i thought the because they made a big deal about how this this film was such a big leap for the the people who
that was that was it was it was good i looked at my watch only a few times which is a good thing but it put me in a really it put me in a really bad mood i don't know why yeah we did there were three of us who went we were just all grouchy really grouchy when it was over
for being i know and we we had nothing to do with it but uh we were not responsible but we still felt the thick blame for what had gone on we could have
movie theater and it it helps the projectionist there's a little oh an old man who's the projectionist and he befriends this old man and then it just tells about their friendship that lasts through all these years
and it's just i mean if you don't mind reading subtitles i thought i had to kind of get beyond that those little you know reading the little words at the bottom of the screen but um oh i just laughed and cried and
but i was interested in reading before i saw the movie did you like it
well we did you know one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck and so we went down to the bank and they said sure we'll give you a personal loan it was only a thousand dollars that we needed
pretty young and we were just kind of like well i guess that means these credit cards are closed and we didn't you know about six months later we realized we could use them and so we charged them all up again
you know these people have secretaries and these high power jobs and it just seems like um she she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care
well i well tell you ever since my my kids are just small babies and i tell you we we really want to go a lot and uh there's so much out on video now that it's almost you know the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it
yeah yeah they probably i i wish i would've bought the tape when i was in uh in because uh i think about that a lot but you know when i first moved here was when they well no i guess it was about a year ago they did this
so i mean i i live in a nice area and i rent my home and uh we aren't sure we're gonna buy a house yet because we don't know if we're gonna be staying here
you know i guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough
neither of us have a problem with it we've particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and and such it's uh it's a scary thing to know that uh you just don't know what people are doing uh before they go to work
yeah well it's it's unfortunate i think that everyone doesn't have that opinion um some people just yeah i've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that but uh
well and you know if they do find someone who who is uh having a problem with drugs then they can get them the help that they need as opposed to just letting the problem go on with without any uh support
but uh i with so many options now available you know where where cars are concerned it just seems like there is
i cannot imagine that you know somebody i heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollars car
about oh oh it would how exciting it is to make that kind of a purchase and i thought i don't think i'd find that exciting i'd be wondering you know here i am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money
if you can find one that's reliable uh you know reliable if you can get someone that you trust to buy one from or you know make sure that you can have it checked out well enough
and uh i was thinking about it after i got off the phone that that i really you know wish that there was some way
oh i've been i've been lots of places my last vacation was actually in i guess we that one would count uh that was about a year and a half ago
no maybe it was about a thousand dollars maybe a little bit less i don't really remember for ten days including all my meals a guide a car the airfare and sorry but this is from
yeah maybe for if i needed to do work part time like four hours a day i might do that because like you should get enough stimulation from me the rest of the time but uh i just think that you know when there's two year olds running around
and so we'll just have to see how things work out but i think the whole you know ideally i think the
uh-huh so it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal i mean because there's a lot of background noise that you know people can hear so it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up um
well i don't yeah i didn't mean compatible i meant comparable my brain is going to mush
right but you know so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick it doesn't cover
i can imagine well actually i don't
uh that the computer would fit our needs and we these things won't make any sense to you probably but he told us there were we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer
and he told us there's two sixteen bit slots and two eight bit sorry two sixteen sixteen four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user and we can put full size cards in there and so we said great you know we'll buy it and we put in our order
and at this point we only have one board so it wasn't so bad so we used it a bit but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in
right that's completely it the salesman didn't know so we went back in and we struck an agreement with the people they'd change
and see now we're dealing with having to bring it back again and they say they can you know do something different and change some connectors and we hope so but it's a hassle you know you know it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing
well because these guys if they um give us a hard time we're going to say you look you know if you if you can't fix this to our satisfaction we're just returning the computer
i just yeah i just have uh well i like electronic stuff you know for one thing i know their work you know cars i think are not made as well as they could be
well i i think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship the people just don't care about what they're doing you know the whole nobody cares nobody's nobody's really paying
yeah and also i think well i do research and so i'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever whatever work
but i think a lot of it you know i think things come both from the
deposited it and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and um late fees and things like that and i said well i mailed you a check and you eventually did deposit it
well my husband and i both have that and i don't know what we pay for his card i pay i think i have a gold one so i think it's like seventy five dollars for me
i and i don't understand i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it but i don't understand
i do not know how they do scale down there you know here it would be a huge amount of land
yeah i think my dad put some we have a little pond at ours at his vacation home too
no so we do not know if it is living or
well we we'd want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys the goldfish too but yeah we could see i do not know if yellow catfish live up this way but catfish do i think
filleted filleted on a plate i think maybe i think i have seen once or twice in like the museum
well i can tell you that the opened i think two days ago because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game and i couldn't tell you who pitched but they won the won but yeah not my a lot and then somebody else lost
and fried itself on the radiator behind the dresser i'll never forget that because i remember my brother he came home and he counted the fish and one of the fish was missing and they couldn't find it anyplace they couldn't figure out what had happened and then they found it fried on the radiator behind
and i don't know if we got rid of the dog because my brother was allergic to it my brother had asthma and some allergies which i think he's outgrown now but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards and then he had fish
how did this work a male rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said you know this rat is acting really strange i think he's sick and she said i don't think he's sick i think she's pregnant
we have a really high turn over rate oh yeah and and this is i mean there are streets just called
if you like food like we do i don't know if that happened before or after we moved here but um yeah you get a lot of uh great variety of things here
oh we're sort of in the middle of uh the extension of the country too so we have um a lot of ambience provided by you know the the bands and everything you know like you said jazz bands and things like that you know you go out and you
you just had to find it you had to wade through it and find it
well okay see we're getting back to last year that's probably the last movie i saw um i just adored it
vegetarian kind of you know feel good tribe you know sort of thing so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world nobody can get along peacefully
you know what went on here but but who knows how it's supposed to all end you know on the on the broad scope i mean
like i said it it it had a much bigger thing i think meaning to me i think about you know just the meaning of um
and i thought was just i got a little sick of his mug on the screen every three minutes but he's the director you know um but yeah i just thought it was
yeah well i must say though uh i listen to do you consider her country
let's see well i guess i i have
listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that i do like some of that uh she's kind of is she kind of country
you know picked i've picked up a little bit along the way that i probably wouldn't have if i'd stayed up north you know
you know so well i think there's music all around anyway i mean i think life is just music so you know you can hear it wherever you want and uh
uh you know i i think of i get real tickled when i listen to some of the old uh music you know the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still and
yeah so it's kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff but i don't know well you got any more
yeah it well i mean just recently i would say i would give it two years back when it was i think bottomed out
um you know i i just wanted to see if you know you had an opinion about this or you know
i think i mean if if i start this i just wanted to say that um
i mean that i mean i'm talking about the whole middle eastern and and maybe this is too general but i just believe that um they do not look at democracy the same way we do they don't understand it as we don't understand the way they live
oh well that's that's a couple thoughts on it i i guess you know i'd like you to maybe express something here
overly he he is abounding in kindness let's say and his life is so i mean every thought they have a totally different life than we have
i do a little bit more than i think usual people do because i am here alone during the day and i like it just for the noise
anyway i think it you you could be susceptible to stuff and it has to be reinforced at another level too but anyway what would you watch if you had you know this week to watch i mean do you like specials
you know well there's certain things i mean i've got um my in the kitchen here and um you know if there's something like cooking shows i love to watch cooking shows
but see then my parents i think then you have to replace it with other things you know to uh
i mean the wives during the day you know get i guess so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day um you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff but it was the guys that got together and did all this and um like my husband just
barbecue and i mean all guys i think like to barbecue i think it's caveman mentality but um he really does cook and it's a good thing because you know you can't you can't knock that but all these other guys do too
um but it's fun i mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff and you know you get all prepared but you're right it's very very rich and i'm glad we don't have it every
oh it is i mean we have bakeries around here that you know you you just gain weight going by the door you know just like that really but i don't know i guess some of the best things i've ever had um
i have a kick making that i mean you know i get off on strange little details of food i guess but um
that was good i think and and the other book i am trying to think you know like was in the last year and i think i did read and uh you know yeah
and so i decided okay i'll just you know have them paint this little room you know a little ten by ten dining area it took four days
and pretty soon before you know it you know he's run into so many problems and it's just there's nothing there to be a problem i thought but um it just took him so much longer and
how much you know more do you know than i know about this whole situation but he just kept painting on those doors you know and each little um paint stroke you know the paint wasn't going on right is what it was
but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints and you don't know what you to want to put up there and by the time it's on
you know we worked something out because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long he really came over here to paint i think because he kept offering to paint the outside of my house i don't think he did the interiors very well
well it's it's not that easy it's like it's uh i don't even know if i you know i would not even recommend this person again to anybody i don't know
a i guess you get i i don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say well i'll accept something or you just really have to get on their back i mean about things and and working with what they say are professional painters i mean
very much and i think you'll have to agree and since we were in uh sort of the ground level the bra burning of the sixties and and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be
um and i think you know it got off to a really radical it has a radical fringe to it that um i've sort of backed away from
um you know on the other hand i don't know that men have changed that much so in in contrast to the women's changes um you know the men stay steady and then the women change around them
you know ten years that they've had to you know restructure but i saw the greatest the other day i got to get some for all my men friends it says let men run the world women have more important things to do
right but um i think men and women both have valuable valuable assets to offer
but um i don't know i guess we've gotten more of a in in terms of that i think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles and but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles
i tell you what i don't know what i would do without my friends having all their kids i just love the babies and and since i'm sort of in a medical situation where i can't do that it's
yeah that's true i mean boy i mean i would have had so i had so much guilt to begin with and the changes that had to take place
it would have been incredible i think of um you know all the social changes that were going on around that time
and and the sixties as being so revolutionary in a lot of ways in terms of raising people's consciousness everything from well i mean i remember we had the first back then you know we got out of school at at uh the university and we celebrated
well you do you'll you i mean there was there was no name to it it was everything that was started in the sixties you had you had to fight for racial equality
that's see that is your commitment you do not know what you are changing when you do something like that you don't understand the total commitment it takes to be a parent
and i think you know the more we try to you know shape that the more input we have into
yeah but we we grew we passed them on to you you know i mean i said you i mean you know because it takes a lot of hard work it takes writing letters to congressmen and
and you know just being very very politically astute about how to shape and mold the future and and um you know um did we make the right choices we do not know we will never know
i well i have uh these well i don't know if they consider themselves animals anymore they actually you know sort of take over the place and and we're kind of their pets
and then we had another guy uh that thought told him to kill his
you know we have plenty of convicted guys that go into jail and come back out do the same thing and go back and
i guess they do that so they don't get scooped you know so they have the big story
and then i know we put i guess it's like
no no uh but i think a person needs a way of defending themselves
you saw the guy came after him with that big knife
they don't let you take guns to work do they
oh i haven't seen the movie read the book but
yeah they say a million people are infected with the virus and
and my has um i guess saddle saddle colored
well i tell you i firmly believe in exercising i think it's a i do it everyday on a regular basis i
just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles and you can you know you can eat anything you want drink anything you want but you don't you know within within reason you know you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical your physical being and uh
well well that's why i think uh if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like
oh it used to be a in the basement in the ground floor i don't know what they call it now kind of moved
take if if you like at all i mean and that kind of stuff either one of those two you go through a hundred bucks without half trying but it it's it's it's nice really nice place oh you don't have to spend that much i'm kidding you
i know where you mean there's a and all that kind of stuff uh on that one corner that's about there i think isn't it
it's one area that's uh really i think hurting the economy more than anything i think the taxes have just
yeah there are there are and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that i guess you know unless they really want it buy something that
said that all you know if they gave back the ah deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be you know spending more money using their credit cards
well like booze you know example they keep raising the taxes on booze it gets to the point
what they call pace group i don't know if you've gotten into that with your kids but that's for the
uh classes for pace classes i think uh this happens to be uh
i understand what you're saying and there's probably some truth to that i think that uh generally i don't
well she goes in and he says well i think this is what it is but uh you better go to the hospital and have one of these things thousand dollars for this uh
you know it it'll help me diagnose this i mean uh you know i suggest you go have this thing insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital
and you know i said to her well look you know if you feel you got to go go but i think a thousand dollars these guys i don't know what it is but there's no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day
i don't care what anyone says those you know the costs are not it's a picture
like it was three days after it was born and he was the one that delivered it and they got four attorneys one guy out of he introduced as snake he says well anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars
well i don't know if i have any or not i i've always enjoyed it i sing in a church choir on nights when i'm around and
i think uh you know as any city grows up uh you get
but i guess when people do those things they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time it's looks like easy pickings and away you go right
i think when you have haves and have nots you're always going to find people that are
true i think they there has to be at least a counselor and we just recently had a counselor at elementary we didn't even have counselors in elementary we have always though had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids and
but you know if we can keep them in school
then that that helps a lot i think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too
it is and most i think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children and i think we make a point to do that
well uh i guess if they'll replace them then they assume they shouldn't have broken
where they are burning a lot of coal and oil up more up north i guess uh i think it's a bigger problem with the car pollution antipollution devices i think the
as well as it landing on the leaves on surfaces like you've seen what it's done to buildings even where it's really bad
so i don't know in there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power and they recycle the fuel and then instead of of some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become uh bomb quality
you know control be able to control it i don't know how long that'll take but
it's just we can't control it right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out so it isn't not at all and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field so that's not going to work
who knows what the future will hold
and so we we take it seriously we enjoy doing it i enjoy my group at school it's a lot more fun to exercise with somebody than it is to do it by yourself
oh yeah i yeah i think so yeah there's been a lot of changes i think there's still uh a lot to be made though um-hum
and you know if if she wanted to go to combat i do not see that they should stop her i personally would not want to go but
and that was mainly it was so when we pulled up the light would come on but also we have a boat back there and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief so we thought with that light you know it would
they ask me you know what are you doing in a dress and it's usually i haven't done my laundry lately ran out of jeans
well i never gave it any thought myself i was hoping you could tell me what you thought
we just uh quit using them and they got us in trouble we took a loan and paid them all off
we keep them uh we keep uh one gas card and uh and uh just you know in case there's an emergency or something but other than that we don't use them anymore
so i said shoot i need one of those
i've always thought about maybe transferring up there and i thought if i do that i might not have a job
my husband'll say that he'd like to have a little boy to take hunting and fishing and i'd say well you can take a little girl hunting and fishing just as easily
you know it's she just eats weird
i know i don't know how people can afford kids
i mean everybody was real upset you know when they fired but you know now it's like you know they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that
well i don't know you think you'd you think you'd uh go up in space you had a chance
so you never know what what may occur but
you know it gets it gets frustrating when you take it outside and you know and then it runs right inside and it does it huh
and so it i mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to you know tug on it to walk it i mean it just goes like a mad dog i mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping and
um-hum well we've heard bad we've heard some bad things about some of those you know they
i'm telling you you think they'll sign
right i think this town'd go crazy if they ever got a even a play-off team
i know what you mean i know what you mean
that's that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable but still worth watching
i guess it depends on what channel you're getting you know what system you're getting it through
we don't do a whole lot of watching but that uh i don't know if you heard him or not they got a twelve year old twelve week old baby
imagine or not they make a they make a luxury
not a lot of farmland there mostly it's uh i mean you know there's you know individuals with their own own farm uh growing their own food
uh it seems to me from what i've been able to find out that's considered a pretty good program it's nice and small which means you know
no i think if i was going to have a dinner party i'd probably have uh
but uh you know it's it comes in mighty handy
now how you'd implement that uh software wise or mechanically i don't know but uh it sounds like a very impressive piece of piece of work
they all take the exact same starter they'll interchange completely i mean completely one starter will fit all of them
that that does sound neat but i don't think i i've got a quite enough nerve to do that
i know my husband's gone uh for several days on the before and he said that you can a lot of times you can go for you know a good day before you'll see or meet anybody else on the trail
i don't know uh we talk about sometimes going up to
i don't know sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far
and in the long run we're all paying for that so it's i mean it it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that
now i haven't seen in that had um
so i thought man i don't know if i trust this or not
that's something i never thought about getting you know checking with to see what what your credit report looked like
see i was trying to think if there was anything else
i was going to say do you just mix it to taste okay
man i'm going to have to think of that we're getting company tonight and i've been i've been debating what to cook because um my one of my guests is a vegetarian
kind of informal segments i've seen but i never got to see his actual nightly news i liked i did grow up with
did that help you understand a lot what was going on your your prior experience with the military
so it can give you you know current news updates current weather updates things like that and it's it's offered through the local phone company free of charge
so that is something you might keep your eyes open for i think it's it's catching on throughout the country
well i can i can spot a kid who really you know whose parents spend every quality time with them you know outside of the work day and when i take care of some people's kids you know when they when they have teachers' holidays and that kind of stuff i will take my friends' kids
when they were like in junior high and high school i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and
there really wasn't a choice i mean the finances uh dictated that you had to go there
i don't know you know what the realities is going to look like you know we're putting money away already uh but i really think it's important to put these children someplace where in addition to
what i consider the the the perfect disposition but you know what you know what scares me about golden retrievers
since they've become so popular you get what i call backyard breeders which is probably where yours came from people that don't know what they're doing and
dumb retrievers and i'm and i really fear for the breed because i love that breed but i really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined
oh yeah you bet you you bet you you know how they came up with the retriever don't you the golden it was bred out of several different retrievers and they bred it for companionship and uh uh disposition and and ability to hunt it was kept only by kings
but they selectively culled those litters i mean for many hundreds of years and since it slept in the castle with its master i mean it had it had to be of a disposition to make it you know an animal you could keep around that closely
but you'll see i mean if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for shepherds they will say on them bred for disposition conforming
probably about you know four blocks away liked the area chose to stay inside of it's a uh
i think what it bottom out about a year year later
yeah there i go yeah yeah well i hate to say how long that will last too no this area up here is uh all custom homes and it's
yeah well but still i know that this one was built for two ninety nine which is nowhere near what we paid for it and i think or somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot heavily wooded off the golf course
i don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot off the creek and eighty on the creek or if it was eighty and a hundred i think it was sixty eighty
or and that's pretty much what it was built for it's got an awful lot of nice things in it but you know i don't think i think it's going to be a long time if ever when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities
don't well somebody was telling me i know somebody who lives back there i've always questioned the quality of construction and i don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house
but one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill per month last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month and i thought
and he was talking he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here and i was thinking well you know i know why your damn bill is so high it's because there's not a there's no insulation insulation in those things
any yet you know they they show very well uh they show very well unless you have you know lived in a lot of houses around here or
if i i think if we had to sell now we could come close to breaking even
trying to keep in shape that way but you know it's hard to find i mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what i'm finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are
i think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way
hum do you know if they have child care there
and i'll tell you how they handled this and i was just outraged i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been uh terminated
the hell is going on here you know and they told me that uh oh well you know you know your husband works here and he's got a good salary we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway and uh
and it took me about a year of arguing i said you know you've got to put this in writing to me and because until they put it in writing i couldn't get my insurance benefits and i couldn't get my uh termination benefits either
i still don't think that they after my experiences that they could you know get me to go back ever again
i really think i am i mean that beats any offer i've heard in a long time
and it's uh i don't know if i would call it
been there you know they weren't a state and the only the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to you know who's going to be going there and i keep telling my husband that and he keeps saying oh no i thought okay
well you know why they actually held them off
boy don't tell that to a native though i mean my they fought and won the whole thing
you know i think i read when i was about ten years old or so which is about the developmental level that you know you need to be at to read those things and i still even then i was so so disgusted with it i tried to read
somebody gave me of probably about five or six years ago i don't know if i'd call it science fiction or fantasy
plot it it total even having read the book and i've read that book probably three times watching that movie i couldn't figure out what they were talking about
well see i'm i'm debating whether or not i want to go see the movie after having read the book i mean the book is is chilling just chilling
you know what it seems like we are doing it here forever we bought a a large house that was completely unlandscaped i mean it it was probably probably was
you know what i bet you they are
yep well the you know nursery men will sell will sell you things here and they are they are kind of in a labor of love the other thing to do if you really really like the hyacinths and i do is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them
first of all i'm gonna to tell you i have two little kids but they're not in public school yet i i get i get that experience starting next fall with kindergarten
well i heard a a frightening thing actually actually i didn't hear it it was told to me or suggested to me uh that to work as a teacher
of uh people to teach math and sciences and somebody said well you know you could go in and and substitute teach
at seventy five dollars a day and there's always going to be you know uh somebody having a need for a math or science teacher i thought they're letting me in to you know this would be this would be frightening i don't know anything about it
right and even if i knew how to teach the subject matter i don't know if i'd know how to handle that kind of a a group of kids
i tell you what i'm finding frightening and this comes from you know the the aging hippie near forty mother so i went through this period of supposedly you know cosmic social enlightenment
and they're in the same classrooms and i guess also you're going to see the first of the uh crack kids
you know what has you know has has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who's above average is now gifted
uh the first time that i saw his schoolwork uh i remember being you know taught and i think you know it you have to teach how to write an answer and you know how to construct a thought process
and at an early age and if they can't i mean if they have missed that training then somebody you know before you're you you start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they're thinking
so i don't know you know it does make me nervous
there is a whole lot of stuff going on out there and and part of me says i just would like to you know shut my eyes and pretend it doesn't you know go on
or send them to private schools and then the you know the old social conscience says you know i'm not working i don't need to work maybe i should volunteer to you know teach what i know
yes yeah but they wouldn't know what they're doing
years ago my mother was that way the same my boys the our you know some people say oh the boys shouldn't have to do those jobs the inside jobs but we never were taught they had to do as much as we did so that was good
oh what was the lady's name that ran a couple of i forget her name now but you know who i mean
well uh sort of mixed feelings about it i guess uh uh i i side i lean more towards the control side than than towards
yeah and i you know something about banning is that you know there there are so many weapons out there that it they're not gonna disappear anytime soon um and they're already
really come down on it i mean i i grew up my father was a hunter right and that's and that's sort of almost a separate issue i think we've generally been talking about handguns and that kind of thing right
the question is i mean would i want to buy or would i would i probably actually buy may be two different things
but uh i don't know if i'd want one of those now well i of course i would want one if somebody was was giving it to me but i maybe would buy a
oh well it's uh it's worked you know it i mean it's exactly what it is you know it's just a it's a cheap little you know little car just to go you know running run around town in and uh
well yeah on the other hand you you know given that my wife likes those i i occasionally like to watch them and and so uh you know so it's you can always count on her to watch something like that and she'll even watch things like karate movies and stuff which
i just won't do it i mean she's paying i don't know i don't know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest and i just you know i just refuse to give it to them if i need to borrow that kind of money i'll go to the bank and uh
well i mean it's it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process right that you've got
i don't know i guess i suppose that that that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're gonna have is is is
you know i mean you're gonna have to know what people are doing and uh you know and how
because uh it's not gonna get solved if you know if people are still trying to you know like besides like you were saying you said you know where you
going into politics is you know what you're doing is is really trying to serve the community right i mean you don't expect to make any money out of it you know maybe you gain a little bit of local fame but
yeah and uh you know and i think that the the the problem with having you know junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with uh
penalties yet on the other hand uh i don't know i mean there's things that seems like it's it's it's the right thing to do now
you you you you never know if it's gonna be applied applied
oh well that's much more reasonable i was involved in a a club like that for um that you know where we tried to really do gourmet uh meals and uh we
i don't know if you heard uh heard about the uh recent legislation in um um against a power company
and um in particularly in the winter months so they it was uh a landmark case because it's unusual to um i can't think they they were talking about shutting it down or if it didn't comply and so on
i never did see the full story so i don't know but they said that it that it really caused so much smog over uh the in the winter months that they couldn't do the uh piloting uh you know the helicopter trips and that sort of thing
it seems to me that i'm more uncomfortable and you know my eyes sting more and so on and so on so i suspect that it's it's an ever growing problem
well um there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that i know of they're they're women but um and usually they're the tea type things you know where they have a little luncheon and they do their thing but um flowers are primarily the emphasis
well you know why because i grew up in and that was my mother's um favorite bean she always she always grows you know five different varieties but that's the kind that produces the best
um by using the thuringiansis which is the uh little well in fact that's what they use for gypsy moth i don't know if you have had that problem there or not
because it really was good even though it is such a long movie you know they said movie but it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone
uh at that hour and i thought that you know that would not have been the sort of thing i would have wanted my children to see at that age uh i mean when they were young and here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the
that has gotten to be a whole camp idea idea now though you know if you hear that music you know everybody knows what you are talking about
see i have uh teenagers in my house and of course sometimes they rent movies and you know have friends over or something and sometimes movies are here that i did not i am not even aware that i could have seen you know because my family tells me that that that it had been actually in the house before
although now i kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll i guess it makes me think i'm young again
a teenager late teenager i guess i can't remember the year became popular i think it was done by maybe the or something
then and she laughed and she said well you know when i was a teenager that had been you know some years before she said that was a a version of you know a song then and she said it's very similar but they've changed a little bit she said i like the original version better
uh-huh and i i you know there's so much available that i don't understand why they do that but um
someone else noticed it and i said well i guess that's true and it was somewhat melodious in other words it wasn't just you know it was really funny
um and he's really the only one that i know of personally who got himself really messed up um having having been involved with drugs but
but seeing what drugs did to him makes me see makes me realize what it could do to people you know in the work force as well
um so it seems to me that that um there needs to be some ground you know some rules that protect
but you do have to research that find out what works for your system what kind do you have
yeah oh well well encourage her to try other things because um i am uh i work in a school system and i teach writing and we use the computers a great deal for word processing
yeah i knew what you meant yeah
um i have a tendency to i'm in from and i read you know how our politicians voted each week in the paper
yeah well you know i as i said i teach school and
and you know i have lots of kids because they know i'm there late i'm a slow mover to say the least but um they'll come in and say can i stay with you because i don't wanna go home to an empty house
and that's frightening because you know the when i said i i'm i'm raising them i am because we're talking about boyfriends and we're talking about
a woman was raped in i read in the paper oh about a two weeks ago now and all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help
nobody even called the police to say you know i hear a strange screaming
yeah i always said if i died well i always said if i died i'd come back as a dog that'd be the best way to be
well even if that's so you know really when you look at it they have full coverage they have which you know after you get used to it it's not too bad
you know because when i want to go if or whatever his name is is on duty i go to him
yeah i think it's just like anything else a new concept you know as i had said if i have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen i was insulted
then i think you know if it came push came to shove i'd probably be drug tested
yeah because you know as i say i'm sitting there fussing and fussing and yet i know of you know one teacher who was an alcoholic
i don't usually i just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because i just know i'll never take the time to do it
uh-huh well i think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference
oh yeah yeah it's a lot more relaxing i don't know if i could take the pressure of having to make you know put on this really fancy dinner for someone
which makes her i guess even if she had papers which she doesn't but but we love her anyway she's just a lot of company to us we didn't
yeah well i live outside of and it's kind of in a little suburb so i feel pretty safe out here but i know the murder rate is going up every year
i think the laws have gotten so lenient you know the court systems are too lenient
yeah they do that here too but i say you know they commit crimes let them be overcrowded you know let them suffer a little bit
yeah i think so i think if they knew it was going to be really horrible wherever they were going maybe they'd think twice about doing it
people they i don't know if that's just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything but that worries me i wonder what the next generation will be like
yeah they were saying in that they can't hire anymore policemen but they keep losing them all the time and that uh you know eventually we're going to be way short on the number we need because
right i think that's really good i know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something
you know one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing like on a morning if they've been out at a party night and
i like to watch those skins games do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain amount you know for each hole they win they get the money for it i think those are pretty exciting
oh i think that they should go ahead and go to the uh fourteen one i to me it's just fair you know and equal it seem like every area should have an equal voice
yeah they really make themselves look bad and i don't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one
we take we take our dog camping she likes
yeah we well we have quite a few but we don't really use them a lot we have well we like a lot of gasoline credit cards because we like to be able to stop you know when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a station but as far as like and
for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars or something i think i can't remember but we decided let that one go and
right i think i would agree with you on that too i i can't see any point in keeping someone who's obviously beyond any kind of rehabilitation uh keeping them you know paying for them to live in prison for years and years and years
yeah in some eyes i think some people give up that i think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges than
think what most people think of them as
yeah in general terms i'm not so harsh but then whenever i hear of a specific case you know where someone did something then it's it's like yeah put it to so i i think i probably tend to be a little bit harsh too as far as that goes
to continue on with their happy life just because you know they they ruin someone else's life
well i think it's a good idea i think our justice system needs a major overhaul and i'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it but i think they've got a lot of problems
if they give them all the information i don't know when it comes to sentencing phase i guess they tell them if a guy if the person has a previous record and stuff
some of them disagree i mean some of them said one way and some the other
yeah i think i don't know how i feel about that i think maybe uh
yeah i think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average off the street
i don't think so either fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad
i think i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know actually make them do something that's not pleasant
yeah my husband was complaining the other day because he says every time i turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling like yesterday i was telling him you have to you're supposed to squish the plastic jugs before you take them up there
but they won't take them do you um take your papers somewhere or does someone pick them up
i'm trying to think if there's anything else i could think of they're talking about going to curbside pickup in our in our city do you know do you where that is
and i don't know if they decided to do or not but i think they said it was gonna add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill
i guess it just depends on how they manage it i don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff the center that their got now where you take your stuff in i think i think that should be making some money
uh more of the cans you know like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable i don't a lot of that's that recyclable steel and i don't know anybody that takes that
right or you don't know what they stand you know where they stand or anything like that
for the candidates so they think well you know why vote
yeah it also seems like maybe another another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if you know not enough people are voting
yeah i think they should change the whole system so that it's easier i think i think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle
yeah that would be i usually vote a lot of times i'll vote a straight party ticket just because i don't take the time to find out what every
ah i thought maybe you lived in because that's the complaint i make to my husband about the radio station too i said oh they're playing one of their ten songs it seems like every week they pick ten and they just play them over and over
yeah yeah i like to hear him sing he does a good job
so i guess hopefully i'll have time for more hobbies i do not know
did that did that seem to because that really that got national attention national attention i guess having a woman governor running against a man and whatever
you know they i think that's what you just said you know having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school uh
i think that's much more important i think i'd i'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs you know that uh
i normally and and parents hate to hear this you know because i actually teach college i hate to uh
one of the reasons is because you know the kid doesn't know exactly what they want and i always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not going to be your career vocation
yeah i always you know tell them that you should major in something you you're going to get good grades in because that that's always i think more important
i would i would it would i tell you i live in
and um and i really think i i think i'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school
because i think their parents pay more and i think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated
where at the public school i don't think as many parents are public are are college educated and i don't i think because it costs less the kid doesn't take it quite as serious
uh but i think you can also get a bad education at public or private you know i you have to really you have to look around at the school i think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for
so i think um i think you're right that there's a lot of there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition um
i don't know even i think the random drug testing i don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs because they're still being caught that make sense um
right i i think that that that's a terrible thing you know it's really funny though um i guess my dad was hit by a a drunk driver who was also high um when i was probably eighteen my senior year in high school
and nothing ever happened and from from that point on i became so anti-drunk driving you know now i think people should be allowed to drink i think that's an adult responsibility whatever
so i guess you know there's that family commitment um i know that my parents my mother's trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can
my grandmother would like to stay in her house and my parents actually said you know that they may have to take their end sometime so because you know my grandma actually says who she wants to live with she's pretty you know she lets people know
yes i'm just a little bit too i think um i think i was worn out worn out from after the war
but i think they just have a whole different world than we do so i don't know but i don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be
uh those i wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do
right i think i think they realized we would probably never push him out and uh i think the other probably all of the other countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out because
from the so i guess they're saying well you know we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries from two ways we can either act like we're gonna be
you know and i think most of that is because their parents aren't around that make sense
yeah something like that no one's you know or or fathers are just missing you know so there's no uh
uh-huh well i think you know they did that in
i guess i you see i guess it depends on your landfill space
though i think i think we're supposed to have something implemented by nineteen ninety three though
yeah so i think hopefully if you know i guess a lot of the large organizations probably did they advertise on television how successful they are
yeah because i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television you know they'll just come up and say you know they'll show you they'll to encourage to encourage recycling
yeah i i think really probably what hit people's you know i know that here in the up in the uh
and then they're saying we we estimate this landfill will be over will be full in two years unless we cut back
so you know realistically you know we had we really had to start we have to start recycling in some some uh geographic areas it's really tough
well in some ways i guess it it doesn't become really cost savings until you have an industry around it you know because i know that like in
so but others you know like tin cans and plastics are are really uh efficient you know they uh they melt they melt on quickly and can be you know just because of the heating and things yeah and glass yeah
and i think um in fact if if i had to do it all again i you know i after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about
i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old
um i've had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the you can have them delayed
and i think you know we have such a need now you know i taught you know i think i was paid
um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors
things i think it's a really good idea and even if it is overseas see i never i tell you sometimes i worry about things overseas because we have such problems right here in our own country
i really think i think um people you should i you know the kids today i teach i spend a lot of my time teaching college students
uh they've increased funding for the some of the i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known when they're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the and some of the other overseas programs uh
you know with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the the problems we have with and cancer and and that how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know
you know and that's it even and i keep saying now you're going to have to save a little money i don't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through it doesn't work my mother always said money so we don't
for shorts for me and things for the summer you know so i guess i can't you know we've probably almost paid off the sewing machine with uh
and then she waits for them to get their color back and then she'll polish them again i don't know whatever so she stopped for awhile boy what a difference they buy nail polish every two weeks it's uh gosh and lotion oh my goodness body lotion
and that makes it sort of expensive but see i live within my i live within my menial very menial income and she doesn't she doesn't live within her her professional income you know so i just get a
i think we'll do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent and one telephone you know well it'll cut our telephone bills
yeah it was there it was burning it had to be spent you know but she said everything was on sale and i'm like oh oh that's good at least it was on sale that's good honey i'm glad you bought it on sale what else can you say
so i don't know what they are going to do
um where you know he then they waited a couple years and and he got himself pretty far along i guess they didn't have kids until he was about twenty seven twenty six so by that time she was so well
established you know i guess it made it a lot easier but uh i think the longer you wait the easier the easier it is if you have that
i don't i don't know if i want school's very important i'm an educator myself and my wife teaches and i it's a very important part of your life and i hope to read with my kids but i don't know if i want my kids to go to school at four
boy after you know after about two months i realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems and i bet and they could be traced back to just not being uh you know being moved between
yeah i i think i'm i'm very lucky um because of having you know flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule
you know so you be will home with your kids i you know it's really funny is that i i picked this career when i was in college because uh i think with my commitment to family and um wanting to spend more time with my children
he was all rung out from the day and i think he he missed a lot of um our up bringing you know my mother i i came from a family that that my mother stayed home until we started school um
and uh uh and and yeah i think um i think i have similar views that's you know where our elementary grades um
she can tell you know when they have kids come in for they meet with all of the parents and she can tell before a parent comes in normally you know give or take eighty ninety percent
you know what the parents are going to be like when they come in and the responses the parents will give back oh yeah
student teacher ratio and still done well because when they would come home you and your wife would say you know what did you do today if we let's sit down and read together yeah um-hum
he didn't make it no i would have liked it if he if he would have though but i think uh realistically you know you read the the research studies and uh i don't think he would have made it simply because
as as an athlete i just hate that go head yeah what were saying what were you saying
yeah i can the van pools i know that i know i'm in the area and i know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas but if you want a nicer home you know beyond the suburbs you know i that's necessary
where is hometown you know it there's really uh most people have relocated to the area you know
and uh she's cleaning house an and it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job uh for you know which is you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there you know from what i pick up on the news uh
i guess like i like and though nothing i guess nothing is as as awful as abortion but like gun control
the political organizations work you know the same i know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose and
and both of them are uh both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know there's there's always that difficulty
it would never happen do you know what i mean
it's only because they make a big stink over it but i i guess actually i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess that's their opportunity their their their right in the sense of freedom of speech but i would never
well that's that's true yeah but i think i i guess
yeah i i guess i guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers um there uh of one of the the appointees for the judicial the judicial bench
i i it's i find it you know personally disgusting but i don't think that i don't think that uh
we have a right to stop somebody from that you know the same i don't know i guess i get i get all all mixed up inside when
but it that's uh that's what i mean see most but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing and it evokes an emotional response i think that's the hardest thing i don't know if i could ever be a judge
sometimes i guess what did i read recently the um the the uh
you know where you know you'd hear what's one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in but in you would that's all you would hear was this is the you know so was sort of a funny thing
right yeah boy that would really be beneficial because you never hear the you never hear the news basically on the radio i never get it
it's a little hard it's a it's a you have to plod through it and you know it doesn't doesn't have a real story or any plot you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on
and now it's gotten uh that uh a lot of those people are died have uh have died off or you know what we are left with is the the relatives of of of that group
smaller unit and you know we we tend to try to do things i think with with our immediate family as opposed to this extended family of people that we may or may not remember or know you know very well uh
right that's what i that's i ideally i would like that in fact uh you know i i've i've thought of that possibly uh give i don't know that my wife would go for it but you know i would i'd like to do that
so i i've still got a couple years payments on it i may uh if we can hold out till then you know if i get get to where i need it something else maybe maybe buy a van because they are really really nice for for long trips especially
you know it's it's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it you know if we're going to get anything out of it so so i'm i'm
right now uh that's that's her problem our our daughter's problem you know because when you when you get out on the road like that and it's just long stretches you know where they just have to sit you know in town she does okay you know and even on the road she does all right
for a little while because she'll sleep some but you know she she wakes up she wants to to get up and i know lights uh to coming uh right around we were we were uh right before we had
you know she was pretty good most of the way but then got to a point where she just had to get out of her seat and we had to stop and and we got out and played in the snow and put her back in and she was fine but you know if we had if there was something to where she could kind of get up and and move around like you say on
you you too i hope hope everything works out
i like the i like the convenience of the in in a certain respect because it uh even though you're once you find the doctor that you like it's not a problem you know a lot of people complain saying well i don't want to uh
be have to be told who i need to go to but you know if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference
because you can you know if if you find someone you really like and then we did find several good doctors and um
you know and have you come in you know they they charge five dollars a
well they and then again they're also they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay you know they they get a lot of uh
i think too many parents expect uh the the school to teach uh the moral aspects of of things to the students to the kids and you know while we're not going to worry about uh
expect them to to pick it up at school and you're not going to do that you know you're going to carry carry with carry to school uh out into the world you know what you learned at home and uh
well you know in a lot of cases uh like that where you know if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it's it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving them
you know you don't have any any kind of a environment good environment to live in you know it's kind of hard to say well you need to take care of of other people's stuff as well when you're when you
oh okay when you said it was quite a quite a way away i did not know it that meant you had to drive like an hour or
you know when you have to do it that way it makes makes your choices a lot easier but
well let's see i have not you know there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools you know just like you said
you know as as i think that less good shows being on has caused a lot of people to do
you know to get more movies and watch i know we've we've done that too in the past uh we don't do it quite as much now because huh our baby won't let us watch them but uh
no i haven't done that uh i know someone who has and and she's uh very uh pleased with it she told me some of the things you can do and it's just a a very uh handy tool to have
let's see when i when i went away to school i'm trying to think my criteria i guess when you're when you're eighteen or so um it would be important to know if it was a coed college that was a
you know what what they want to get out of school and um
decided to drop a course or decided that they needed another year that then they'd have to take out a loan to continue
i think so too i think i think because most kids don't have a car at college the ones that do get taken advantage of
some some places um start them as early as i think well some some places take them as infants i guess you know like eight weeks even
oh yeah well um that that sounds that sounds pretty good because i know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends not so much now but to um maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds and
uh-huh oh the wild flowers are beautiful i think um i was thinking about throwing some for in the back just where the kids um just way in the back behind the swing sets so that
i think it's true i think also people are having children at a older age so maybe like um you know you go through college and then you maybe work for a few years and then you have your first child
just seemed like it was a lot i don't know how i admire people that that can do it all but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i i want it kept it is hard
but you know if you have the type of job i have a friend that's a nurse and she can pick her hours and that's a a great career i i wish i would have gone into uh nursing because she has such a flexible schedule but it's very hard to uh
i don't know how many you know what percentage but some are will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children i guess i see that happening already
yeah yeah i mean i can see that research is needed and you know definitely i mean it's becoming a major problem
but uh i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them focus on uh preventing it uh in more you know
yeah i haven't either i've heard you know uh different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough and mostly that's what i've heard so i don't know
so you know a bill will come in and i'll think oh no i didn't know it was going to be that high but so far i've been able to we've been able to pay it off every time so
and then i i figure if there's big big news i'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or someone else you know
wanting to hear like i've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something and i don't ever hear it in the news here you know it's um
yeah well i guess i can just say i uh it bothers me that i hear a lot about um you know on the news that
so where are your places what what are places you you know memorable places you've eaten
oh okay because i was thinking well i grew up in i get it
see i when i went i thought the people drove me crazy first of all but then i just thought the food was over priced for what it was
oh i thought sometimes they say you know this is three minutes or whatever
and there'd be like thirty people so people talk about you know big family reunions and i think like i have a friend who just went to like to some big ranch you know where like there were four hundred people
for for their family reunion and i so i mean how i would go about doing it is i would just call all my relatives
now it's different because i live here and i've you know when i go home i try to see the families as much of the family as i can but it's real different and i grew up in a real not i think not normal setting
and i um i usually watch uh either or the every morning while i'm you know whatever i'm doing and i watch that i usually watch the news either at
the thing about it you know now that i've found found is that we get such good coverage on or at least such i don't know attempted thoroughness of coverage by the time you get the there's nothing in it you don't know
yeah if if you know then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or something because really i thought lately there's nothing new in the
right and i i think there's an attempt to do that uh you know i think people there's a mild attempt for that but i think basically we basically associate news with bad news
i mean you know i remember well just the things that are covered i remember watching the during the earthquake and just seeing that happen i mean you know that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake
uh i think so he teaches a lot in at high schools but i think he teaches at
my parents are pretty active and uh it was very scary and but now we've seen you know uh black people have a lot more civil rights
for me when i think about social change that's what i first think of because i can remember you know separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything
mainly because i a lot of it has to do i think with more women working in our family you know twenty years ago not that many of the women worked and now uh almost all the women work
well i think just also you know
well and they're you know they're they're saying right now we don't know what we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties
you know not a lot of people do really know what you know
and it's still we're still having showers for yeah uh i don't know where where it came from but it's been really we got a lot of uh
it's so humid at times but here it's it's just about right it's it's pretty dry and not too dry where you know you just it hurts to breathe but we're just about right we're just having this all this rain and
yeah has a sister who has four she just had her fourth one in uh and she doesn't have to work either i don't know how they do it
i don't i don't know how people do it with one you know um obviously
and not have kids and i think for society for such a long time said well you know you're married now you need to set have have your family and i don't think it's been until recently that that they had decided that two people was a family
but that's that's probably because you know if you had three you you know would say if i'd of had four i guess it's always not not being able to picture one more but in essence you probably would have worked out fine
and it's and a lot of people in our we're the only couple in our class except for one other couple who are in their forties and they can't have children who don't have children and they can't imagine why we would want to have children and i'm going well you know
there's more to life you know there's life in there that's you know not everybody has to have kids and i'd rather spend the time with my husband than you know spending time here it's your turn you know
finally said you know said that that will take care of us when it's our time
i was raised totally opposite how we got together i don't know but because my mother had six girls
yeah i think you've you've earned that though
so you know i think we were you know got a good deal on it considering yeah yeah yeah well
the backyard is just huge it is just really i think another house could fit back there
winning a sweepstakes and what would we do with the money and said we'll i'll buy a bigger house and i said no i would just fix this one you know there's you know because we i like where it is and i like how it's laid out and it took us forever
and to put it all back into an apartment would just never work i can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff and it actually fit you know of course we got it on a little bit of more furniture and stuff but
no the ones next door to those there were there's a i don't know what they look like now
yeah there was a nursing home and then there's an apartment and then there's another apartment and we lived in those those third ones and they we moved in when they were brand new uh you know we drive by now and think gosh you know look how much it's changed an
we saw all these houses for sale you know and i think now a lot of them are selling and a lot of sellers are getting close to what they want instead of you know just having to give it away
you know as as i said i do
i mean what basis you know of comparison do we have really we don't get a you know
i don't know we're supposed i guess we're supposed to wait or
yeah and it was really we were laughing i mean but you know we don't really do any gardening so like that took like a minute
and then we just talked about you know whatever i mean
you know you uh you you know you you tell a person what uh news their a
i had an aunt that lived there and she she couldn't stand it anymore she moved out because she said the whole island was taken you know being taken over by the
was it yeah i'm pretty sure that's right my hairdresser she went last year she said she went on a cruise and i'm thinking you know cruise i'm thinking
your more intellectual magazines but it's nice light reading you know if i want something intellectual i usually read a book
which i think it was either yeah it was they they told me you know if i didn't subscribe they were gonna take me off their their winning you know their list so
well i don't know i just think uh you know it's
it's light reading you know you don't have to excuse well you don't have to concentrate you know you know it's entertaining you know and uh
because there's just nothing in there that interests me i don't you know i don't i'm not into recipes you know recipes and you know
i thought you were going to say there i thought you gonna say there was a snake in the weeds
well the uh what i really i don't like is the call the constant calls people selling things people telling me i won things
i don't know why i guess people on the weekends from out of state uh i don't know you know but
uh i'd say one thing we've done have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it's a real easy is just baked potato dinners
it's we invariably end up at my house since i've got two kids and that it's it's fine because then i can just say okay fine you bring this you bring this you bring this we're done oh it's pretty cool
huh now i've done it with where you put you cook the rice well i guess you probably could do it some way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a bit of white wine in it
well i don't know if you know but has got a real big recycling center
we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them
i don't know if if they do it all over but our does a a newspaper recycling every you can drive up and they have one of the clerks out there no the bag boys out there
but it was i thought it was a pretty neat idea they i mean their city hall looked better it was nicer than and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city
oh it's we i know like i said i've got a two year old and a four year old and that's
i thought now that looks sharp that looks real sharp
yes but that's all right you know it's it's made too which is good um but i i've ever since i guess i was i was growing up my dad's always had
it took me it took me five years
you know you just you get started and and you change your mind or you wanna pick up a second major if you're management you you you decide i'll i'll take that marketing it's just what three more classes
you know if you're gonna go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one
finally i said let me get out of here
i think uh we might have a a lot better a lot more efficient running government and and a lot better laws passed
and uh just every time i'd start to get into the movie it was it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell hey there's you know or you know they'd they'd start recognizing people
so but i thought it was a good film but you're right i think uh i think it was very one sided
have you seen the rest i think i've missed one i'm not sure but i think i've missed one
and i think uh that's making and others realize that
well that that could be you know what i we always we think of the and we think such bad things you know but i wouldn't doubt if the people think and they think such bad things you know
oh yeah oh absolutely that's part of that propaganda thing and i think if we can get away from that or if we can keep that out of our minds ah excuse me i've got a cold today
i think if we can get that propaganda thing because i'm sure both countries are seeing seeing it you know thinking and and all that but uh
well you know who i'm talking about
and so we used to go camping my dad would take uh there's there was four of us kids we'd he'd take us you know we'd all go camping my dad and my mom and and the kids and
what i always remember is my dad would let us pick our camp spot and uh he'd always tell us you know okay look for you know a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents and
but it was it was always fun we'd always mom was always prepared and she'd bring along something you know something because tradition had it we would never catch anything so we always had
i don't know if that can rate camping but you know it sure beats driving a thousand miles to
the last thing i can remember doing where i had a sixty six and that was all right because like you said that was pretechnology days i guess
why you know everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has land um
as soon as he took the stuff and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just you know scanned it so i don't know why what that was reading it for
uh you know oh they have all these different names for things strategies and all these different things but anyway one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best
and um so he sat down and i told him i really wanted him to build the train and we would put it under the tree and that i would keep it together i wouldn't take it apart
i was going to say my kids both eat it i guess that's one thing that i particularly like um but i think it's good for you know for for company too and i've made it a few times um and you can make a lot at one time
i think uh i think if i wanted to badly enough i could convince somebody
yes well yes i but i was from conservative and uh you know there was there was nothing on it which makes me wonder you know if it's as uh prevalent as as some of them claim
you just don't know and it all you know unless they're caught in the act or the the the child is very badly you know beaten up it comes down to a one word against the other
i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt you know if they release them two hours later he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty
you know so just absolutely you know first class fly where i want to rent a car if i want to
uh you know just really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and and not worry if somebody says well let's take this little side trip you know and not have to sit there and figure out um
i like both of those real much also i think basically they promote same thing they promote family values
well i haven't either uh i i hate returning things i mean i have i have a friend who if she likes something isn't sure what size somebody might need will buy it in every color and size and
but uh i think more often than not you you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time and uh
you know if if you buy a good one you shouldn't have any you know too much of a problem with it i mean we we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law
you know i i everything is so automated uh and things can be made without i think a human hand ever touching it you know an awful lot of things and i think uh that certainly makes a difference from
okay yeah then you know what i meant with rain ah
they were both quite into sports and and you know so whatever you know they would do we'd go along with and uh
i know it and i think i think that's really sad because i think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else
uh-huh yeah i i think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life style than necessary
i don't know i i see it as a major problem and i think it's going to have to swing back the other way because i think we're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this
and uh we found that uh we found a real good interest rate you know when they're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that they really come down on their prices and uh
i know i've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the you know the second and third grade uh if the kids had you know proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that that would make a lot of difference
well we went to a uh cat show at the here in town and uh we thought that we have a cat now but we thought well if we ever get another cat you know we'd want something kind of unique so
i told my wife about it and i said you know this is just a i can just hear the dog crying for me now and and is coming up you know hint hint and so
that uh you know you can throw money at it but it's i don't know to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know because i mean the general values that we're teaching
you know do you get the oh that's kind of side tracked but uh i just remember seeing on the news the other night they had the thing about how schools are doing so much better
i thought well you know of course they're doing better and not so much when i was growing up uh schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools but uh
i mean it's been a while since i been in high school they're even in grade school when they do that but i can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that but you got to think in a way it's
there's they might be saving money i mean even if they had to pay more now i mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work even though it's higher productivity is short-term
and the kid at that age especially if they're going into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want an and i mean choosing from my experience you know my i thought you know my i know what i want a lot more than my parents know what i want
yeah yeah i think uh i would agree with that in fact the thing that i'm going through the same thing where in graduate school i was trying to choose you know a particular institution might be better
like say you know the of in or something might have some top specialists in my area yet if i go to of or or you know some you know any big name school
and uh when i was in school and needed extra money and i know how i feel how i felt as a provider of child care that even though you're you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to
to let them go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything and
yeah and they don't uh i know my who lives in our neighborhood they've had their they've parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and
and so that's been something that's been good for the you know in this area that you feel like um you know there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today and i guess i don't know how people live with that everyday
oh that's right i think now that i recall reading about it in the paper
i don't know sometimes i feel i mean i do go to church and things i don't know how i would feel about it but like you say if it hit you personally closer at home you would feel feel differently
do you think most states have that or
hope i mean you you hear of people who have um committed crimes and then they get out of jail and they go and they do the same thing again and you wonder why they can't just stop it
like constantly it seemed like but fortunately i had small children and i didn't have to go and it's not that i mean i think everyone should have to serve on the jury it's just that
um-hum and i know when i spent the time that i've studied in uh since was one of my majors in college that uh there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards
you know what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them and that we weren't normally very interested in them and they have in other in most countries they
well i guess then i will go but i made me stop and think a minute about
not worrying so much about the crisis i know that it's not settled but there are other areas that we could focus our attention on well thank you you have a good day bye-bye
well i just uh i'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go in and call the shots like you say and and i just would prefer that i mean sometimes we've said let's keep
i don't hope i'd i hope we don't try to keep uh
we're just saying let's get some grass
but i know when i lived down in um on the outskirts of there were some towns like that had oil refineries
yeah so it's just um you know why are why are we doing this to ourselves i just don't know but um i you know what really amazes me about like that area and the oil refineries is
yes and and how you know if they have all of those um
well i really think it must i think every i mean well think about how many automobiles there are
especially especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didn't want him to let you know to like we had some job offers in the area and we thought well you know he would be really commuting
and so he priced around and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it so he thought well i can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars which he did and then
he really hates to spend the time it takes a lot of time if he if he thinks it's going to be two hours it's four you know whatever it always takes him twice as long but then when he's finished he's he always says well now you owe me
and well i know once when we had a we usually round inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our car but um once the muffler needed to be changed and uh
and so he used they used car repairs kind of as a way to have uh you know something that they did together
and he thought that turned out pretty good because it you know it helped him to understand and be functional now and it helped him to have a close relationship so
well i think so it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school um
well i have seen a big change i think in high school kids that my relatives and friends that um i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with
what my what i was going to study and at least i had some interest in a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are they say oh i want to be a doctor i want to be a lawyer why because they make a lot of money
music to listen to but and i back a long time ago when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty and i listened to some of it but i you know now that there's just a million rap groups and
unless there's something i'm particularly listening to but you know if you go two or three years without having that what i got the most exposure to
you could record it you know uh if you have i guess if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something that you'd heard or that you owned an album of so won't be nearly as handy
yes i know what you mean i know my husband he um
it was kind of hard for me to think here's someone who as wealthy as he is didn't have to pay any income tax that he said that year he claimed he had didn't have to pay income tax and he thought well you know there's some people
i think i like our country compared to the other countries i've studied and visited and um i'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services i enjoy how do you feel
well for myself that the income that we have we're paid a certain salary but i think the employer keeps in mind
this'll be deducted you know some so many taxes will be deducted from it and so i think we're you know our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it and so i think you know in that way we're compensated
like the nine o'clock and so i will turn that on while i'm doing some work and i can hear the news not have to sit right down and listen to it
well he didn't have too good of opinion of it no i mean yes i did hear that and so um i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor
yeah my husband does and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes and says oh i just heard on the news that such and such happened you know if it's something really interesting and and then i'll know to
well i really think so i noticed on channel eight that there's all of the um anchors
well we you know like all of the stations seem to be pretty good it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into so we had a
in uh and everyone kept saying oh you're going up north it's not going to be so hot it's not going to be so humid and yeah that has just not been the case it has been
they you have to water your lawn and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy and you know so you're going do i want a dirt a green lawn or a muddy feet in the house
it's you know has it like from one foot to four foot and i thought i would never buy a house were there is a flood gauge down the street
so i think one day one of our kids said you know someone came home and they said well when is dad leaving or something it was like that they thought that's the way life was that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time
and so i think um it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family
but i do think um you know like the current trends are that um the family unit is devaluated it's not nearly as important we find that
right i know who you're talking about i haven't i have seen it i think maybe once
whatever time he gave said oh it would take me about just about four hours because it was only about like eleven or twelve hundred square feet over there
and he said oh it's going to be just about four hours well he was gone the whole day and he said well all i got done was the taping around
um is able to guess because i know my husband he he painted when he it was just the preparation time was so long that when he actually got down to the painting part
uh most television where you you know you just you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but still understand what was going on
uh-huh i think so well i guess i'd better close now so i can
of when a person person reaches seventy five uh and i can't remember what day they call it but but uh
the way he talks to his and so forth and i guess maybe there are some parts of that but i didn't really see that in there but what i've read about it they
talk about that but anyway we've we've enjoyed that and and uh i guess mostly i i like the news shows too and the news magazines like seconds or or
it's it's um oh and you know the the kids will get you started on stuff like we've wound up sending in one that's something i didn't think that we'd ever do
yeah our oldest grandson pulling his tooth he's he's he wouldn't let us pull it and i mean it it got to the point he was eating a pear here and he bit into it and it was just hanging by a thread
and i and i'd tell him you know it's getting ready to fall out and he walked around the house with his face face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he wouldn't let anybody pull it
but oh and and i haven't told you i'm going to be at a different school this year now
you know whether whether she would allow slacks and she said she doesn't have a problem with that she just didn't like sloppy dressing
and i don't know you know i i think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know are they gonna put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties
i don't know that that looks that bad but if you're going to tell the kids they can have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too
well and you always course it's a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today or there
there's usually yeah there's usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen and i i don't know how a coach would feel if uh that teaches health or
right that i didn't ever understand i mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so
really and i don't know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the kids i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and
i think it it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying so it you know it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place but that's unusual
so i i i would really rather know however there's got to be some backup to say that if if somebody does observe you at say at a party
and and then they say well if you give them the right to do this then they're going to take some other right away from you but i i a firm
a lot of our neighbors say well what you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure it's that and you have to it's uh we we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans
and i thought what are you complaining about
then and then they say well hey you know mom used to do this and dad used to do that and pretty soon they're they're figuring out that's not such a bad way to go but
so i told them he strangled on some chicken
and then she was upset he had on two different shoes one of which was not even his he had on a pair of slacks and the wife said slacks and she said clean
the people out of jail as soon as they're out of prison when they do and then having them go right back and the day they get out they're back in crime and and especially when they're assaulting people and then killing people i mean the man that killed those three sheriffs
we tried to start that in my husband's family his mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago and i said well let's start this letter
um learning about that i'm i bought a i don't know if you've heard of her her cookbook and she talks about catering and um
oh i think i'm i think i'm a hacker but i'm not not kind the not the uh the you know dial around randomly trying to break into computers type hackers no that's one of those sports i don't go for
oh yeah i think i would i think that'd be neat
but uh uh he and he does a good job and he says he he uh guarantees everything he has sells
yeah i saw you know the guy that plays uh
tell me what you like to do
and um i thought was beautiful i liked the hills and the trees
yeah that yeah that's the other guy i was thinking of was yeah fact i think both of them have performed here
oh that's great well i do like and i and i like it you know i don't know i just i like the people on it i guess you know
i know they kids already know who it is i don't know who it is though
i think that you know it's good you know sometimes i'll have the cookies ready when they come home and and a lot of my boys uh my older boys' junior high friends will come over in fact everyday i've got boys hanging around
you know who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college education thank goodness i have mine and i could get a real good paying job if i wanted to you know do in fact i still have offers you know please come back and we'll pay you this
yeah i didn't know if there was anything else and i use the but anyway well yes is wonderful
i have a question on this this thing that i'm this survey or whatever you know this i volunteered for
well i understand what you're saying i think if you would listen to it a little you would discover that it has a lot of roots
you know the guy was caught burgling uh and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught uh you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say you know your pleasure your honor
uh i just think our system is overworked and we're starting to stress the true meaning of of right to a speedy trial
either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case and let's you know let's get rid of some of this harassment suing
well that may be right it's in there some place i think we both know what that we're talking about the foundation of our legal society
i guess the the started out with we'll treat you fairly i'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say
and what do they say about finding adequate child care i think that may be the key word
and then you don't really know what happened we gave up on one babysitter because we came home one night and found
well i almost felt like it was too much indeed i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening
what the state that the world is in and try to guess where we're going
yes uh maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things
but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement uh you know once you get passed thirty three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation
i understand understand though it uh believe me i do that myself and i disagree with you i don't think it's the worst investment in the world
i have a an eleven year old daughter now who's saying gee dad i want to be an allergist and i said that's wonderful i applaud that let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that
well i certainly hope so we have a a classic ranch
i don't know what i'll do up there i just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so
and uh it's it's tragic that you know when people live so long that they uh
on this this homes but i just don't know how much you can see when you go for a i think you just have to drop in all uh unexpectedly a lot
so i think it's probably better to have some sort of a a at least a record but my dad's was so precise that i mean if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what it was spent and
oh i know it it it some of it is so tough and uh uh especially when somebody's um planning one for you and they know what what's good for you i think when we do it ourselves we take the easy way sometime
so uh you know i i forget from year to year i'm getting too old but the um
yes it is seems very high it hasn't bothered me but i know the people that have allergies it seems to be a pretty high
there been a different turn and then i don't think we projected what was going to happen uh after the war well it got over so fast so uh
well it uh just came out uh i guess yesterday it's called the and it's uh it says um big story in the paper about it today trying to comment on it that
and so it seems like there's you know always somebody digging things like that but i'm not for sure we know exactly what what all happened in that situation so uh
yeah i just think the i think if we had been very i mean if he had that good of a correlation through the then they could have uh
well you can at least uh give give uh uh give them the awareness of the different cultures and uh you know have all sorts of um at at least you know let them know what
but it's uh it's something as you know as i said won't go away so uh
yeah and we need to have more and more of them i hope i think i hope that is not a lost art that people getting together as they do spread out all over the world
well we need to have another one i hope my aunt is successful as uh later well it is probably not going to be done because i have not heard from them i it was supposed to be this so i don't imagine there is anything coming this is hardly almost
anyway i hope both our families get to have one soon
um-hum so it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home but it won't be that long because we not for sure you know how long they're gonna stay or whatever
anyway well it's good to hear from you and i hope we hope we did them some good uh on their little computer and uh
and then uh who knows if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway
i think they need some definitely need some pitching
his assistant and i think that's a a great addition i mean he seemed to know what he was doing and and uh
candy and drinks and you know sweets and whatever and then at the end of the month i you know i get a bill and i'm thinking what did i get
yeah i i know what you mean about the interest rates it's uh it's unbelievable
and i i guess there's some there's uh uh some negotiating there too because i heard uh on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is uh
yeah in fact that's that's what this guy you know he wrote a book on it and he says that's you know he's tried it several with several of his cards and he's just told them you know i i can get this card from this bank
that i uh that i miss i guess is uh you know some of the
well i tell you i i've had my fill of unions i use
you know what i watched a little bit of uh of the game and i uh had to leave um in fact i think the were ahead when i uh when i left who won the game
oh i know i'm yeah i saw the i saw the uh just a little bit of the highlights of the uh game
they're really i mean not a whole lot you know i mean you find them they're find them be to be pretty loyal uh you know with with the local teams
and you know uh you know i used to think that that one one player really doesn't make the club
they well help them make in terms of you know what they're they're wanting to do you know that that's a big influence i think and you know what not only whatever what you can afford but what
uh you know you you you need to go to a school that that handles whatever it is you want to do
uh you know we uh you you situations like that you don't realize you know until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others you
how good her daughter was and uh she had cards printed up actually describing describing you know business cards describing her daughter's uh you know she had won several different twirling awards and all this and she was
had these business cards she was passing out and it was quite a production uh i think some parents go a little bit overboard
would you i mean if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place or
financially i'm there's only so much i can do for them and i'll say you know here's what you have got you can either you know go a couple of years locally and you know then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it but
but uh you know so i think that helped me be real serious about it and i i ended up graduating with like a three point six
and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it
you know i i guess i can see it from several different perspectives but
you know when i hear about things like you know what they've what they've been reporting about in
you know i to me i don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy you know maybe there is i don't know
you know you you you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they won't do that you know for any for any situation really
uh you know when i when you find somebody just like that situation i mean it was disgusting when i read about it today and and when you find someone like that that you know is guilty he confessed already to killing eleven
i i'd you know i guess i have a hard time feeling merciful toward him and you know
i'm i'm not saying i i think capital murder or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case you know especially because there are some cases when you just don't know and i i think there's a a shadow of a doubt
right right and well i have a hunch i have a hunch that you know the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway either i mean you know they i don't know from from what i hear about jail life is not any any way to live but uh
i i just really don't see much use for this guy in you know for instance i mean that's just i could see capital punishment in a case like that
but uh you know i don't know i i struggle with it but i i really think that in
because i don't know that anybody would in i don't know that anybody would feel good you know like if you let someone like that loose in your community you know i i i'm sure you'd have to be scared to death
yeah yeah he's a nice guy i take it you live in the area do you live in the area
like a lot of them that used to be considered risque like and stuff i think they they maintained people would watch them because there was that uh
oh i can't think of what it was called we saw that too that i was pretty disappointed in that one yeah but uh so you know through the summer we have small children so we don't get to see too many but we've seen i guess two or three movies this past summer
yeah it yeah but you know i'm sure you're familiar with that living here we go we go through you know quite a bit we go to from time to time and my my parents live in southern so we drive up there and
and you really like it there huh i've heard so many people talk about that area i've never been there but they sure say it's pretty
yeah well you said you said you worked a couple days a month though what do what do you do
my wife leaned that way and i'm really glad she did and you know i'm glad she's staying home but you know i know there are some days when she wishes she wishes she was back at work but
so yeah that that's a tough situation but then then again you know some you got to do what you got to do
uh-huh well well like i said my wife normally feels that way there are days when uh i come home and she says here take these kids i'm getting out
well you know in the next year or so you'll see so many instances where you know he'll mimic something that you've done and you see you know everything i'm doing he's learning from
you know they that's how they're developing their patterns and i think a lot of people either don't care or don't realize it you know that's
okay so um how do think how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years
yeah i definitely think that has gotten a lot worse and you know i i think there's to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values
yeah think i think there's more pressure like on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be and
yep you must know him his reputation precedes him
well uh he uh boy he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief they they say it's what makes him happy is to give us grief so i can believe it
yeah he he misses it he used to go back twice or three times a year you know because he missed it sounds like you haven't been back there in a while
um speedboats uh you name it they had it and we did a lot of watering water sports but i think uh the thing i liked the best was uh we spent about a summer
so i told everybody what happened and they go oh yeah sure you know and so i get back down in there and and i'll be if he didn't do it again this time a little earlier and and i had let go before then and
you can get injured doing much more than that and i just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that just uh can't take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess
yeah it it'd be kind of nice i hadn't quite figured out i don't have anybody to teach me either that's another little thing you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what i've seen you just kind of work
uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer so i don't know i i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it
to get an even keel on that i mean it's really hard to say well there's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let's give it this amount and then this other one's only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way or
well i suppose we both have credit cards
but i know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand
and uh i saw on they had a program on uh credit cards and they're supposed to i don't know if it was or or some some other state had a
think i want to find something that has a lower rate
you know now they'll take the but i still don't know if will take or
i don't i don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the the the training bit uh i've had dogs through the years right now i've got two
uh you know maybe you need you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes
and we took my my daughter was living at home then and she took our or not the the over there and
yeah as i said we've done them three times we'd be going again this this year if circumstances hadn't changed we we'd probably go my husband would you know the minute i said the word he he he's chomping at the bit
oh that's what everybody says and i i think it i i think i'll try to stay away except my my second grandchild will be born in
get back to our routine i think most vacations uh seven days is enough for us we've gone i think when we went to and we were there ten twelve days and that was pushing it a bit
and uh it's it's just it's just a gorgeous country most people don't realize it i think if they could get tourists coming to their country they'd improve the economy considerably
i guess they figure they're gonna make up for all they didn't get when they should've had a budget
yeah i guess you you have to check yes or you come down to the end of the year and you don't have it to give it to them
and uh so i've been very guilty about not making the effort to to take things where they belong
it seems seems to be i you know i it really does bother me when i think about you know leaving our children with with this sort of uh
area but you know my son comes home and tells me that you know he hears kids talk about having guns and um someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun
right you just you really don't know so i find myself being a little a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than than i might normally be but i do feel like it's a an invasion of my space and uh
each teacher is expected to to deal with in some quality way i think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job
well the explanation i was was given about you know they they seemed to admit that it wasn't working but they didn't have the money to restructure but looks to me that it wouldn't take
isn't that interesting i don't understand how they get this this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money i don't know
you know i i don't know how young you'd have to go but i think by the time they're oh early teenagers anyway i think it's too late now at least around here um
that that get the youth involved in that sort of thing you know like i said i think it does
i don't know why i got stuck down here in i think it's called a job i don't know
um-hum yeah we went uh we took the southern route and went went through uh uh the again and we stopped at uh
yeah i know what you mean
well i've been pretty lucky in that respect i don't charge like i say i've i been trying to
or something like that so i'm not exercising at the time at the moment so i wish i could i wish i did have the motivation to get out and do that but
sort of contest you know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that and that would keep you going
you know it was there was points you could you you would make and you know there was a point to it but running and jogging and just not going anywhere it's just i don't i just can't understand that so i don't do it
and i made the tuna fish sandwiches and everyone i mean i'm i think everyone knows how to make tuna fish so that'd be easy for me to make and i can't go wrong with it
but i guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know and it it's kind of dangerous
i guess yeah i guess i've never really uh thought about the fact that like in they they have a lot of smog problems
um you know they have the smoke stacks i guess you call them i don't know what you call them and different things like that
yeah that's why i thought of it i thought
i didn't know if they actually did that or not i know they were i know they were considering it
i'll come in and i won't know what i'm doing so i'll wear a pant suit in case i have to shoot
i don't i don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that i just i don't know it just it takes too much time out of my day and i don't i don't know
i just i don't know my feet bother me and
basically you know i i think you know that the whole idea of
how easy it is to you know have the prisons release people because they're overcrowded
you know and those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work
contribute and i guess that's you know what what we're meant to do and maybe an opportunity will come by that
maybe some kind of of activity little field trips or something i don't know how they would do that but
and the minute i mean the minute something happens i mean i cry on i mean you know commercials but i'm just that's just the end of me
they like to uh share their experiences with the younger children they'll be telling them all kinds of stories that they don't even know what they mean but
and so i got a pretty good feel of you know what i want when i do you know get my house whenever that is um
yeah yeah i think i think they're called or something
of course i think um i'm not sure you know what the time span is but i mean if i think if i used drugs last week and i had a you know had a job interview that i wouldn't use drugs the day before or something and they wouldn't even see it
you know i'm saying they can't they may not be able trace don't know how far you trace i don't know what the you know limits are or whatever
i mean i i took a lie detector test once and it didn't i didn't mind it but i was just offended by some of the questions i guess i mean there was one question do you like your mother you know i said yes do you hate your mother no have you ever killed your mother
and i really i really hadn't thought uh thought about it i mean i think about it because i hear about it
but i hadn't sit had to sit down and and say well what do i think about it you know and that's kind of like today i'm not real sure what i think about it i'm kind of you know in in the middle on that one
and you know that's good sometimes because you need to you know get away but uh i don't think you you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of of losing your family the family unit
yeah yeah and as i understand it i don't know i haven't experienced it but you know kids these days are growing up so much faster
you know and i think i think that's another reason why people are
you know people aren't doing anything just sitting around you know no thinking involved and now i think i think people are trying to get out of that at least and that um you know there's a lot of
and that's probably good you know if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that that also helps that's also something you know family oriented that everyone can do
it's hard to find anywhere there really going to learn something and then yeah you do have to pay you know if you the better the place the more you're going to pay
and and i don't you know it takes me a takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend much less to you know trust someone with my with my child
i mean not that they're going to abuse your child or anything but you just have to be sure that they're going to be watching them you know that they wouldn't let them drink something or
hum because i know they're they're putting that into a lot of uh corporations now
okay i uh i started knitting awhile ago i knitted i didn't know even know what the stitch is called i just had this uh
i just now got some cards together kind of uh business cards that say singer and what does it say a song makes beautiful wedding or something and i've been passing them out to different wedding shops i mean when someone comes in
this one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because i have a demo tape you know if any one wants to listen
right and i know uh i work around you know a lot of teachers and i understand i understand how uh
supportive they are of their students and how excited they are but some how i don't think the students are getting excited
and he was having to uh support his entire family take care of his brothers and sisters you know and all that had an adverse affect on his school life
and you know any other aspect of your life an but now now that he's in this program and you know he's i guess okay he's he's making straight
you know might help you know because there's not a lot being done
and i'd give anything to have that right now in my in my regular life i mean you you have everything given to you i don't see why
people wouldn't want that i don't know i but then if i was young i wouldn't see it but you know now that it's gone i
i guess let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college
you know what she what she wants anyway but that was the big deal and
because i find like on i like to listen to that but each story is like no more than two or three lines
uh i know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news
we got all the information within minutes you know whatever happened we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it
because even though we do get the story right away they were censored as to what they could tell us so all we had to sit here and and ask is well what aren't they telling us
you know like this thing it's just i mean everywhere you turn you know what kind of shoes did he wear on the night and you know it's just like okay this is ridiculous
and and get there quick and then worry about you know because right now in my career i'm i'm really starting out and it's going to take me a while to move up and i don't need anything kind of holding me back um
yeah yeah it's it's just really not there anymore and that that has to do with you know the women getting out and other women seeing women seeing other women you know out in the corporate world that's like oh i can do that you know maybe i don't need to get married
when when the age creeps up where i'm twenty three and twenty four i'm thinking my time is running out you know but i'm actually very very young
you know and so i feel like i'm old it's like i sing i sing and i would really love to become
you know and so i'm going i'm so old and i'm i really have to always tell myself no you're not you're very young and you know so it's
yeah that's that's why i say i feel i feel really lucky right now because because i'm not married and because i don't have children i'm out of school i'm twenty three i can do
anything i want to do anything and so i mean even some days i'm looking for another job now but and i get so depressed because not because i can't find a job but because i can't figure out what i want to do
and uh that was pretty good i enjoyed i saw with have you seen that yeah
and let me see what else have i seen what have you seen
oh i know what you're talking about
yeah that i don't know why i like that movie so much i guess it was so much suspense
and they found out what happened when they did leave him alone one time but i won't tell you that just in case you see the movie
i think i think though that movies are losing their luster kind of i think movies are losing their attractiveness just to a lot of people just i think i don't know because of the cost and i think it it's just losing its originality
if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done because they would they understand people more they understand helping people more they understand the plight of people
i don't know in a soup kitchen or something they would understand how other people live
and so i think you know before the father would work and the mother you know would stay home and having that mother there that base i think was a big part of of family big part of
i know that uh i've heard people say that you know when people that went to
exactly but it's i mean like i say we've come a long way but we have i mean twice as far to go still
a lot of different people go there different kinds of people and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see you know some people have lived in all their life you know and so they don't get to see
you just didn't have a car but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools and i couldn't understand it you know all the kids had cars and they you know have to have a car
oh i guess i think we rented a couple weeks months ago
uh i think i know who you are talking about though
well you know i think i read about that too
i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do you know
i don't know i mean i think sometimes some of the the women's lib though is kind of like they wanted it all you know and you can't have everything
well i agree i mean but i hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work too saying you know you should stay home you know otherwise your children aren't going to you know turn out or whatever because that's not fair to
not working or whatever i mean i think it's got to be a personal choice and
i don't know i found when i did do some work when my son was young it was like contract work and it wasn't where i had to be there every day but
i mean we're going to the doctor once a week so i don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor
yeah because i finally asked because we you know we had all of those milk cartons and there was nowhere else to take them and they had it in front of and i ask in and they said they moved it just behind
yeah i don't think those milk cartons take up so much room yeah
you know what happened is my husband said i used to complain to pay sixty dollars to get licensed in and now you know so i mean that was kind of different and then to file a
i don't know how much i know about this subject
if it's like you know really a you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to you know to live
uh i mean it's a nursing home or something like that so you know if if i think that that's a good way for people to you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping
to um help these people you know and not i'm not saying just give them money but i mean because they have to be taught to be yeah i mean i know that's what my was talking about you know when you give these people
well if i remember i think we made some like stockings you could make the like the granny squares or whatever and sew them together and make stockings and
it just takes a long time to get it done but you know once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good to to see it but
sure oh yeah well i read that and then i'm trying to think um usually i try to to find something long that i'm going to do
that is really interesting i mean it it's fascinating it really is um but it's so long i don't really have the time to read the whole thing but i think eventually i'll go back to it but it
you know that's kind of what but i have to not only am am i reading reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also um because the board of advisors for this um journal doesn't have right now doesn't have a really respected name um who's a
i don't know if i want to take that responsibility or not but but at least i can tell them what i think so um it's real interesting
yeah that it you know you see you see a lot of small colleges doing things like that right uh-huh because it attracts really a a lot people's interest that's one way it's really good public relations for small schools i think so
and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics and her aluminum and i thought wow i mean how one person is doing that you know but my my thought was
and yet you know and we were just sort of talking about it at the time and here we are you know now we're doing it on a city wide basis in in communities so it's wonderful that we've come that far i think but
i think she was i was trying to remember it seems to me that she was doing it on her own and living in there were places where she could actually take her uh things herself
but i remember her saying yes i have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing and i thought wow that's that is wonderful that somebody is doing that does that yeah
yes people i don't know they find fault in everything rather than say this is a good effort yeah i don't know it's it's i understand i understand i know what you're saying kind of people like that and
yeah well i know um i guess i got a good example from my mother because she was always
for instance she she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for you know when she made cookies it would go on that or if she needed to wrap something for needed uh sandwich paper or something she'd use that
they do the same thing i mean they i think they give me a hard time but i think they know that that's it's the right way
well i don't know you know i i wonder how how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to to make this whole thing work i mean the extra like washing out bottles and jars or
the extra of actually uh making sure that uh you take stuff over to you know some people are complaining are now are complaining because the stuff is isn't picked up at the curbside you know and i think golly you just
you know and i think to myself that's that's crazy i wonder if you know maybe i need to bring that to someone's attention you know and and
she almost she almost just sounds like your father i mean she has everything planned so closely closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a loop
i kind of think that's sort of what happened in our house because i think my husband was not quite as uh good at saving and so on before we got married and i was i was really diligent about that i always putting money aside and when before i was married you know when i was working in and out of college and
in on a a social level and and i think we sing better because of that i think you know i think we sing more like uh
the you know it's it sometimes it will skip like my husband is not musical at all but his mother is very musical and um and his children are very musical so you never know where the talent is going to show up i guess sometimes
yeah well i tell you once you get used to having them you you get spoiled really quickly um
and already know the language you know already know the the software and um i don't know from my own experience um just just so much better than than at least the version of that i used to have it may be improved by now but
yeah it's uh was never very intuitive to me i mean you know you some of the commands just had nothing to do with what you know what you were supposed to be doing what they what they did on the computer computer but uh i mean like going um
yeah yeah and i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper you had to go back and retype everything and uh it was just awful so um i don't know i think we have just become
cookies and bars and things like that that was more my specialty i suppose and they seem to last longer than pies around here pies just would would go practically in a day's time yes
well it's interesting that uh yesterday i had lunch with a friend and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend for friends of hers for um a
one of her acquaintances one of her old friends i guess had been in town and uh they invited two other couples over and so there were seven of them but uh i said have and she said what she had uh just food but you know she had uh uh you know guacamole and
uh i can't remember all she had but she also had made uh flan which is actually i think have you ever made that or had it
you know so papillas i guess would be another kind of a dessert if you decided to do something like that but flan is something you can make ahead and have just uh you know have ready but uh oh i would have been thinking i would like to have a dinner party sometime soon but
but um she's been a good dog to have and i don't know once she's gone i'm not sure if i'll get another animal or not
so you just never know how that works out
uh-huh yes it's funny how um how pets can kind of um oh take on a certain status in certain areas i mean um that made me think of uh when our daughter was looking at colleges we visited a campus in um and
yes it really was it was just a nice touch and it kind of made it seem more homy too but um the i thought that was most unique and it just you know kind of goes along with what you were saying about the dog having sort of free run of the the nursing home
well they were quite a bit younger then and uh you know it they we felt real um safe uh with their being able to to do what they would like to do there in the area and uh it was just it was a really nice place to to camp
but um i do not know i i think we have come a long way actually when i think about you know when things were like even when i you know just when i was in high school and how it is now for girls and uh
uh i guess my i the one my one bad thing is that i am that i wish my mother had had some of those opportunities because i think she would have really she really would have succeeded in a lot of ways that men that women were not able to succeed in her generation
i was going to say do you have daughters that's always a good question because
she's definitely entering into uh a male profession but uh but you know now for instance there are there is uh the organization women uh the of so that is recognized as uh you know a place where women should be
but uh i don't know i you you see it in uh also in uh like in the church uh where more and more women are becoming ministers in uh you know in uh protestant congregations and um
i don't i don't know if you are or you know what what you know about that i am not either but uh
um i was just trying to think oh i know something maybe you could tell what do you think that what do you think tell me what you think about this um the uh the role of women in combat roles during the war
uh one of one of the men who was uh i do not know if he was a general or you know what his rank was very high he said it's just a personal thing with me i mean i can't be real you know i can not tell you why i feel this way but i just would rather have uh a man doing some of these jobs than a woman
yeah well that's good that's good because um i guess i placed all but one or two of my calls and uh only because i thought if i'm going to make some money
it's starting to show um in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded and and i don't know if is ever going to be able to to um totally avoid having an income tax or not i think eventually they're going to have to do it
and the woman that owned the office was saying she'd had this business for oh probably seventeen or eighteen years and she was saying as the years have gone on there are fewer and fewer things that people can uh take off of their income tax
and she said it's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of you know accumulating receipts can't do oh really
and i there just i don't know i guess as you say you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are and
yeah well um i don't know i guess we complain about taxes but i guess you know uh you have to be sort of
just a straight table saw or to get one of these uh rotary arm saws radial arm saws i guess what they're called
well it it takes up less room i mean you you set the wood down and you move the saw whereas if you're ripping wood you're probably better off with a a table saw
i don't know how you would go about uh
is uh to take some let's see cream cheese i think is that what comes in those little blocks
i don't know what we usually have for dessert cake sometimes
i guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the the commercial districts and uh i'm over the northeast part of and it's a in a nice neighborhood the houses here
and course that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex you start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so uh i'm sure that aggravates it also
uh up to a points things seemed to be working and then i i think he he became discouraged
my particular i guess they want us to describe the area so um my particular area the homes run anywhere from about sixty five eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million
and i'm not sure what happened but i do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for for about four years
i think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country now i think what we made a major
which is amazing for any governmental financed program i wish the post office just stop raising our rates um
oh i don't know the guilt that we had out of uh i think maybe we can pick up and go on now but
well i guess i not trying to top you but i grew up in county and i can remember when they built the north part of which was built after the south part of of
you hit a point down there about i think where they call exit right just this side of the county line right along in there somewhere suddenly the air feels cleaner
yes and it works very well because you don't hear you don't have they can say anything they want it's just but i just feel that's my big thing on the invasion of my thing on invasion of privacy
you know when you're sitting there my telephone and i don't like the the the way telephone numbers can be used we once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number but it turned out it had to been my husband's office phone number
um-hum nothing that you felt that you know any experiences you've had at work
i feel that way too i sometimes feel that you know sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit
so i mean i got i was getting really nervous so i finally said we i want a really solid car
so uh i i definitely would want to get antilock brakes so i don't know uh do you have any particular things that
i consider that lucky i'm lucky maybe maybe sometimes i've gotten twenty two it comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving and that's a to me is a real drawback i wish i would you know i could settle for twenty eight or
although i must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads come into a toll road push that button down it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up instead of having to crank it
so uh so i guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have antilock antilock brakes i'd love to get uh an air bag
i mean it just i shudder i would not get the again just for that reason
but i would love i wish an an that you know engineering would make something as solid as a car
yeah and he knew and he came down i mean uh he he came he's been talking to them and and he came down and one of the things that
he said is he went to this weekend and he had an absolutely marvelous time he had a great time
and uh i mean and he they were really nice and but he said is that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better
my other son is just as happy as a bed bug he the moment he knew he he decided early on that was the school he's a classical guitarist
well you know see the advice we give is to not limit yourself especially this you know go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two
well one of the things we said is that they should pick the college this was our advice too irrespective of the cost that somehow we would manage
and you don't these parents know that teachers talk and you know we do check with other teachers and other teachers find the same things for this child and you know how do you tell your parent's the parent hey wake up and smell the coffee
um at the same time i've seen we we have a
um there i mean i mean we're have to be we're alerted there's all sorts of systems where suicide
and so i mean you have to find out whether there's a legitimate reason or whether this is a warning signal
i don't think we've we've missed a fish store on the entire east northeast coast of the
so it was a it was a you know i think they need me more when they were older than they do when they're
it used to be in years ago he moved i guess he he retired and went back to i guess in nineteen the early seventies
and nowadays with microwaves you can steam many of the things in a microwave i don't know if you have one
just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes and if the fish flakes it's done don't overcook it though
the riots weren't because i lived right downtown and uh and what you saw is was what you got i'm telling you
i mean i'm i'm thinking of research in that direction rather than we we've taken the intermediate step but i don't think fossil fuels are the answer
uh so you've to look you've got to look elsewhere so uh but it is something that's a little frightening and in fact well i within our family we have said said my husband i have two sons uh well one one is already in college in
yeah well i definetely definitely advance that well listen i enjoyed speaking with you and let's hope some there are other people that feel the same way
oh well i am just dying to see it i went to dinner with some friends last weekend and they said get a babysitter and we'll all go see and i said ooh i want to see it so bad
no right before i went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on we're going to the movies and we won't well she goes all the time but i go maybe once every couple of months
oh they are are we just laughed so hard and like i said with i mean with it is so cornball and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know just they just carried it off to the tee it was
yeah i think it is i think it is
oh me too because i don't even know if i could live through it now i mean i'm getting around real good and i'm just still real sore and today i was i course i went back to work two weeks after
and i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed and then they called me to see if i wanted to work a day and i said yeah and i went and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that
and uh he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks you've only got two more weeks i said okay fine i i will i will whatever you call easy i'll do it you know
i wouldn't think well my kids are going to their dad's tomorrow night so i sort of think i may go do that
skills you know you don't just add one plus one you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together and i think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think they literally cannot come in out of the rain
so i think you know they're they're trying to head into into teaching them to think and use the education that they have and i think that's very very important
and uh so i think that it's it's appropriate to teach them you know why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this
you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say
as a review but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in so that you know your school district shines throughout the
and i think that's totally useless i think you know there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons but i think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous it's like bragging on your grandchildren
no i guess we didn't have it high enough or he didn't get hit in just the right spot but it threw him up against the wall you know and he slid down the wall
and i'm a substitute teacher and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said my mom's making me get rid of the bird we have too many pets i thought yeah right come tell me about it you know
oh isn't it though you know but oh i i think going to ballpark it really really makes it because then you watch it on you feel like you're more a part of it too
he uh says he's coming back you know and he doesn't know how many years i mean to pitch he'll be at least one more and he said he's been saying one more and it's been two and three might be two and three more he likes it
that's right you know and he said i get a kick out of it uh you know he's he's such a nice man
knocked the socks off of them which you would expect you know anyway but i think took himself out after a couple of innings or something
well of course we wear uh an unlined boot you know it it has a heel on it that's the kind of boots that i wear to work
it's all right for the students they look tacky a lot but i didn't think teachers should you know
yeah it is because you know that it's really and truly a the true thing you know i read one about that i liked
i'm trying to think uh i read a uh a novel that used the names of like and
i yeah that's exactly what i was gonna say i was amazed because i in the beginning when it was on you know on route coming out i heard mixed publicity you know kind of good and bad
i think two i know they lost yeah to and
that's right and that's exactly what they said my wife dragged me away from the television
and if you wanna see them you might just as well enjoy football and i used to tease my husband sometimes and say my gosh you know did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about these games
yeah are you uh transit usually i mean do you stay not in one place too long
no i always thought i would but who knows now i got married and
um-hum yeah that's right i have heard uh i don't remember what they call it sort of like a
if they uh they test for drugs i i'm i can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore i know we did in the military but i don't know if once your in they continue to do it but i guess you're always on call for it
like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better or make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever yeah i i i tend to agree with you
yeah my brother uh my brother used to work for and then i don't know if he still does or what because i don't know if is actually part of it but he you know is working at now
okay we got a couple more minutes then i guess uh think what else i can say about that um
but uh i haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what they're taking all that i've just read a lot about it and i'm keeping these big piles of it right now to try to dump it out this weekend in fact
and i said hey um i understand y'all are taking these bags back uh you know what do you do with them and they had told me that when they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then you know go and recycle the rest and i said what do you mean the ones that don't belong there
and they said well you know people come in and put anything in the receptacles and what i found out is if you look at the bottom of those bags or whatever the plastic ones they've got numbers on them
no actually i don't even know if i checked that or not to be perfectly honest um it seems to have been a mistake i don't know um
you know time you know went went back to school and didn't have time and this and that and and the only thing i do now is i occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what i can do and i
those those are the comments i kept hearing from the pros you know they kept saying you know we we hear you know on on television so granted that it is biased but they keep saying it's just wonderful uh the course is so well maintained and you know it it it rained through half the um
yeah i think that the i think what i mean i don't know what happened last time i remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something and
right and and i don't quite know why it failed um i would bet the push it i bet the push just wasn't big enough they didn't sort of encourage
i mean businesses and things to use it so you know what what i think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while and then and then start phasing things out so
i think though if there was some you know sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over you know and i think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed and
and if they kept it up so let's say imagine they had kept going you'd have you know two or three more generations that all now are are familiar with the metric system not like
and now i think there are enough people you know sort of as we get older i think others that will bring more generations in on it
eventually they'll be able to make the switch and we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying what are you crazy we can't understand you we'll say oh it's a pain in the neck but it's for the better and we'll sort of deal with it i think
yeah but i wonder if that's even something that you know they they have to change immediately they could just you know sort of phase that in so start
you can't walk in here you have to be under well i guess what what i bet what they do in that case they uh see what some of them is like you know they say if you're not taller than this line
it would be a neat case where like where kids taught the parents i think you know
i don't know oh yeah i always forget i don't even know how many ounces are in a pound i just sort of make it up
gee i think what i think he want the calculation at home and it turns out that he was actually pretty close
yeah we we we tended to eat a lot and our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it and we had another friend um the physics major again he wasn't he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology i guess and he got into a snowball fight
um i think they're okay i think they're you know i think they have enough people who are
who are who are still in their prime you know um i mean certainly if you look at them compared to let's say you know um
it's one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are uh uh you know i guess i guess when you start pitching real well well move them up bam you know there goes the little the uh worst team
i that that probably gives the readers a good shot for you know this year or next year i think it you know the young talent really sort of has to build itself up
that's that that's that's something that really true that may sort of that military thing i was speaking of before i think that's that's certainly true i mean his military may just go out and say well we just said you can't do it and we're just not going to let you do it you know so
the idea that um basically they said you know everything happened in kindergarten and and in kindergarten we learned to share
and we learned to um play with each other we learned to take nap you know and to take naps and and whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other
but um i mean the i think are just sort of trapped i mean they were taken over couple of you know not too long ago
um um actually it sounds very i mean very similar they're sort of being they were sort of forced and now they just want to sort of speak up and say hey we want our piece
there there's more than one group fighting for the same place where they all want you know whereas the are saying well we want our own we just want this little tiny piece of land
in your second year and then you you know you had i think you had to pick it by the by the by the end of second you had to pick some sort of major but until then they didn't sort of force you they they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then
yeah well i figure that that that that's probably the thing that i would most tell any parent you know to tell to tell their kids i think probably make sure the kid goes to a school where they can get sort of a general education and
and that's a pretty good engineering school i think i think we do some they have a pretty good engineering here they also have a program a fairly large liberal arts college as well a sort of a separate a separate you know college uh arts arts and sciences college um
and i believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in in in everything and i know people i do uh i do work in language processing and and and at least one person who's in my field started off as an engineer
or some yeah or or or or some other thought provoking area you know very true we had uh when i went to undergraduate we had uh um
went to don't know if you know of it or not um we had uh uh a requirement freshman year of just humanities then you were given a choice of
um you know there were ten or twelve or whatever fifteen or fifteen different courses that that you could take but they all centered they all came out of and departments and they were
from very different you know so so they had you could have one class in the philosophy of something that that the philosophy of mythology or something that actually approached this or um
um i was forced to take i think you know some sort of art history course
yes um-hum and that and that really is something that that i notice like uh i talk to a lot of my friends at schools that are more specialized and they don't have that
yeah i think trial by jury is very good i actually they said i think the tape said something about changing uh
or just you know there are two people who say well he just looks guilty um
someone says to you you know when they ask you if you uh if you want to be on you know when you're called called for duty say oh yeah i want to be on jury duty because i can spot a guilty person a mile a way
right uh but i mean what if eleven other people are saying one thing you know and you're you're the one person saying the other thing
i wonder about those things you know or even if it's you know i guess if they were to say well it doesn't have to be unanimous what's the cut off number seven five you know six six you know how do you decide
is it you know how do you decide what number of people have to say that
i often i never understand you know having again having i'm sure there are some deep seated reasons you know to i mean often times i wonder about rules like this and i'm sure that that that there are some reasons
then they should be closed yeah i mean that's what i think but i don't um
right he he they let him out and then and then he wasn't he wasn't allowed back in the town where he had done this so he came to our he came to instead and they they they realized later he he'd killed about between eleven and twelve women at least
right i mean i don't know what you do with them at that point if you're that crazy but what what struck me is you know they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours
so you're right that's a real neat idea well what but i mean what can you know at at some point what can you do to sort of raise revenue i mean to raise jobs i wonder
right well that that's what happened in other country though and other places they tax us quite heavily i mean they tax imports quite heavily so we could do the same thing i mean just and you know they may get
like i say have someone go in and look and you know and find out where it is we're paying ten thousand dollars per toilet seat or something
it's it's playing at school actually in about in about in about two weeks i guess so we're going to go see that but you enjoyed that
i don't know if you saw or not
really i'm trying to think what else i've seen recently what else have we seen recently oh you know what's pretty cute actually
yeah um i actually hadn't heard anything about it and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie
and and they said it starred um and at first they told me and i thought what a strange combination and
so so it's lot better um you you probably know is uh you know so it it was a strange combination but it turned out to be a very cute movie i mean the whole premise is that they go out and they they die
so you can guess the rest of the plot it actually it's it's really funny because they run through you know they do it they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives
well i'm i'm i'm sure because it seems like it certainly would would would explain the preoccupation with it lately i mean but i suspect there's always been a preoccupation with that sort of thing in movies
it's it's on video now i think and it's probably probably worth seeing on video um actually we really enjoyed it but it was it was it was also right along the same lines i mean they they would go ahead and kill themselves for a few three or four minutes to see what happens and
but it was um it was it was odd enough you know and the and they didn't just sort of make it silly it was you know it was done fairly well i think so actually i actually enjoyed that as well
sort of maintain a normal checkbook you know like everybody in the world does i guess and occasionally it actually balances and then
right well i guess we all have those things though i mean i uh i uh i i go to uh i pay
what i think is a lot of money to go to a karate class you know for the you know i pay up through the year
i actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes because i think you know um i sort i sort of feel guilty if you know given that she makes twice as much as i do
yeah that's just that and that uh that has been our godsend you know we had we've had some sort of major emergencies come up you know where um we also own our own house um we had an ice storm up here recently
it fortunately we didn't have to bring it down all the way but it cost us you know a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down i mean just to take off what was broken there plus we went and lived with friends you know this and that and and then the whole ice storm cost us still quite a bit of money even though insurance picked up some of it
it actually is if if if you have a food processor i don't know if you have a food processor or not actually it it turns out that if if if if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply
i usually find it when i make up for the first time i usually doctor it just a little bit you know my own way here and there and it works real well
because it's just quick it's easy um and the food just comes out you know if you do it right i think it comes out
i guess it's i guess it's so that so they don't have to move troops out so quickly or something i'm not quite sure exactly why they want to do it
yeah that they they they claim that's why we're still there i mean you know why only you note it's only only a small number of people have actually come back yet
i have no idea what i mean what do you know just to imagine that one day they're going to turn around and someone's going to say we don't like you and just start attacking again and
turns out you don't you don't you don't really find bagels in what you find is sort of foods the same foods that you find in um and and everything else you find things called have you ever had those
didn't hurt me you know at at at the moment so um and and i i don't know there's a there's something about there's a poem somewhere i don't know if you've ever seen it or not um um to in
we have uh some friends who live on a lake and it the lake it just seems is is completely filled with bass to the point where you know normally you go you you go fishing for bass you get a lot of sunfish or
they tend to use i guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes but you know i've she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything you know
no was on i think i i take that back
it's about a lawyer it's one of these lawyer shows you know they they seem to be popular these days
i i don't understand it they consider it violent i have so ever i have seen it on
yeah ours is on actually it ours is on at eleven it it's um eleven o'clock now here or eleven twenty five now here in um i think they would they do that i think they put things on at
yeah i think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two and and and force them i think that uh i think it'd be i think most i think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it
so i guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could uh or just or just gave or or just or just forced our kids just to force kids to serve for uh parents i guess
yeah but i mean a a a lot of people would get involved and you know because there were all different organizations to do there was they had a yearly auction they had a dance marathon for charity or to to to support that group
such that you know lots of people got involved that way
you know so so i think you know and and and the kid's certainly not making much money
well yeah we're we're slowly getting everything back together again you know it it's taking time but everything you know we got lucky we had no damage to our house or anything so the rest'll just have to come with time
yeah well i think it it may i mean that in in in that respect i think it may help a lot i think it may be pushing people away from hopefully push people away from drug use if they know that you know well if you use drugs you won't get this job i mean
i don't know the uh that that would actually be an interesting thing to find out i think i don't i don't actually know how long those things stay in the blood in the system i've heard some you know you so some things supposedly stay for six months some stay for less some stay for longer i mean
they think i guess stay forever in in in some ways i mean if you get flashbacks for uh
do you worry about you know this or that i mean you know what what what about their rights to privacy well if they're doing something illegal there they have a private you know like especially in in in the case of drinking you know if someone's
yeah well i guess so i mean i guess i don't i don't what happens actually actually happens if uh
but yeah it's i think it's their way of seeing how how how well you do in a shock situation without worrying about you know stuff like that so
yeah that's uh you know it it it it could blow things right away for them you know unless they say well look i mean unless they walk it won't
i'm thinking walk in and say look i did do drugs you know a year ago and i'm off them for a year now and this and that and so if you take if i take i'll be happy to take the test but it will show up positive of course i think
but i don't i don't really know i don't know what the laws are pertaining to this my wife probably does but
i think on the local elections it's actually um i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because
just go in and say oh i want to be a juror i can spot a guilty person a mile away
i mean that's that's what it what it boils down to is people like to say you know people say well i don't want to be on jury you know i don't want to serve on jury duty i don't want to vote i don't want to do this and that well then they could you know i
you know i think i think that that the people who most need to vote sometimes are the are the ones who who are really out to make a statement because you know when when
i don't know her politics i just know that uh i saw her speak in the eighty four uh convention and right then and there if they said to me vote for someone for president i would have slapped down my vote for
say i i i would think that um that that people like that i think inflammatory inflammatory politicians are um or or emotional politicians you know certain very vibrant politicians tend to bring crowds out i think
well in some sense they they should be politicians in that you know you want them to respect the people and you don't want them to have you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge
so given a choice between you know so so if you have so if if imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes you know anti you know sort of um
no matter where you are or who you are or what happened you know what happened to you you go to the hospital and they say okay just just take him don't worry about you know who or what he is later so
yeah they're the ones who make i mean they're the ones they have you know although i mean it's the unfortunate part of that is that is that people i think tend to forget that doctors are humans as well
given that you know someone decides to have a malpractice suit against them well they could take you know it could be millions i mean unfortunately and and if the doctor whether it was you know i mean i'm sure there're those cases where the doctor was wrong or malicious or something you know but there are you know i mean
no i i think think people are starting to really mean it i mean everywhere you look you're getting something new i mean you start off you know especially um you guys i believe in you don't have state tax do you
right we have we have federal income tax state income tax local income tax we have state tax on gasoline um you know because our our you know so on top of the federal tax on gasoline we have state tax on gasoline so we're just
uh i'm i'm just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places i mean it'd be it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older
you know and and and uh and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who don't need it but i mean the real people who really need it
to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i don't know if we can do that or not
i agree i agree but um yeah like like you said i wonder you know if if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process and i wonder if it'll ever be a change process
they do forget it's true could because everybody think of what happens is whenever the politician whenever the the one who made that supposed mistake turns around and uh his his or her opponent can say well look they did this and they can turn around and say well my opponent did this
my my my my wife has a real job and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck i'm just floored when i see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep
yes well yeah she's not entirely sales so it isn't it isn't as lucrative as one would hope but it it keeps us supported temporarily
uh-huh yeah heard about that i guess a friend of mine had a uh um well she she just started up a day care center
i think i could probably do it uh as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then i could do it
oh i don't know i guess they're you know clear bottles so um you know a lot of people do have those separated
yeah things of that nature so i guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary
just kind of a test a pilot project and it went over so well that they just extended it and it's almost uh i don't know if it's done by a private company or not it may be
i mean it it sounds good to the public but there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something now aluminum i don't know they may be coming out ahead
he uh he barks he'll either bark for food or he'll bark to go out and he'll tell you which one he wants
i think maybe we have but
yeah so i didn't know if they stop you when the time is up or
really well well that's kind of good to know because i thought i thought i lived in a halfway decent area
there's no trees where i was from in and here they've got the mountains the beach the trees you know it's they've got streams rivers ponds it's really pretty here
and do you know my grandparents live in
i think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available and the types of the weapons i mean there is no
maybe i'm a little bit strong when i said total gun control that's that's really not what i meant by i mean we need control we've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the in the in the public
most of it and about this time of year there is it starts getting a little old and i start looking forward to you know having other things to do with my
and i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt uh we were coming in and before the plane landed she looked out the window and she said she said there's no trees down there
i said there are this is you know and when we got out to the area where we decided decided we were going to live and buy a house there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land
yeah i don't know what we're gonna be able to do about it but i guess it's been around so long that
through this kind of an experience but i guess we all do
um because i think it's something that's gonna take them a while to come up with a uh vaccine for i don't think it's gonna be that easy to come up with or i think they already would have by now you know
i'm not sure uh i know uh i've always thought more about the disease rather than the research you know what i mean and uh that sort of thing
to find yourself single again you know and um because you never know what's gonna happen you don't know who you're gonna come across you know course it's it's not that i'm wanting to
you know so i don't know that i think that's i'm not too too much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself i don't know what do you think about that
yeah you know i guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction an would have to have come first i guess as far as
something to uh to do about it so so i don't know um course there's so many things in the world where
and uh so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse and which is the most important to solve at the time and i don't know but um
yeah i think it is i think it is
yeah it does every it seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would you know but uh
i think the first thing they said i've written this down so it would is it possible do you think it's possible to have honesty in government
that we should not expect i mean i think we put too much on politicians we expect them
about people's past and i don't know why anybody would wanna get under that scrutiny anymore
and they also you know ask can we eliminate do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption and i don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally
you know i mean i just think that's human nature that you're gonna have corruption
yeah i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes but when i think about where i'd wanna go
right it's going to hurt the city although uh i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank and i would see the people come in when they were they would shut down to retool
every and go to the safety deposit box and i'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know and they had all these great i really believe they have done this to themselves
until i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it's gonna be too late
and that's not too far away but i don't know how it is there it's very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much i take my paper i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take
yeah it's very hard to find a spot and then i don't know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles that cannot glass that cannot be it could be recycled but there is no place to
so i don't know i think there needs to be more places i also have a real strong opinion in the state i'm from
it makes it worthwhile to take it back and i've just started drinking a new water called i don't know if you've tried it
you add water i'll i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but i am going to stick with because they were first you know i want them to have my business
very little that's another thing and if you've ever know like i know i only use a couple things form that it says this is burnable material well
yeah one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from
but i don't know if that affects outside
yeah in this area too since you know in we're so spread out we have to drive so far but i know in i have witnessed that where it just uh
okay well why don't you start because it said i was suppose to ask you what do you
and it's really sad and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for
you know where i can go see it i i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in
yeah well the only problem with these are that they are very expensive of course i guess all nursing homes there is
yeah it's frightening and i guess uh i don't know how old you are i'm forty six you know we're the generation moving into this and i don't know how our kids are gonna take care of us
yeah that's yeah i think i agree i think that's where it stems from is that and um
either that or i don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now or what the what the case is
i remember seeing that i saw that on
and and go over there yeah but it's you know there's lots to see here
um you know you always sit there and out of each pay check so much comes out of it and you wonder you know where's it all going and we have such a huge uh national deficit and
i think it was one of those things where it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them it was one of those understood things that you just you know either wore you know a dress or
yeah well i think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen and it includes you know salad and rolls and oh some other stuff but it is absolutely wonderful it's the best i have ever had
i don't know if you get that magazine
you know and i learned a little bit about them then but you know what would be fun they have some of those classes you can take
um-hum um you know it's kind of scary i guess because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately and so it's
around at church because i know that they have a limit as to how old they can be before they you know before you can bring them in
uh-huh yeah i yeah i saw it one time and i really liked it but i just haven't uh seen it you know watched it since
well we had a sonogram but we told him not to tell us so it's gonna be a surprise
um i guess uh i like to play golf
yeah i know what you mean
you know before i take it um i need to definitely take a vacation where all all i do is rest and i guess to do that i'd probably have to take it at home
yes i i agree i can i can do that too and um you know i think if i had if i had the money i would probably go to every year
watched it and i was i was pretty disappointed in it because i was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense and i was pretty disappointed in it now it's it's a good movie but i guess uh that they built me up too much
right uh-huh when when i had my magazines at home i would find that i kind of skim through them and look at the pictures you know and if something caught my eye then i might read something but otherwise than that you know they were um
okay well i like dining out of course it means that i don't have to cook but um i'm a divorced woman i have one child and you know when when we dine out
i said who ever i talk to is going to be bored because when it's summer time i'm wearing shorts and when it's cold i'm wearing sweat pants and
yeah yeah i know what you mean well
so um and right now we have their clothes on uh like double racks you know in the closet we made a higher and a lower and it works out fine but they're just about to get too tall where the dresses are beginning to drag you know and
yeah i remember one time we had a progressive dinner it's the only time that ever yeah they are
well not really you know we all took real tiny little portions and uh were kind of angry with whoever it was we weren't sure who didn't show up with the food
i don't know if i have anything handy we were just about we were getting ready to go swimming and we're waiting on my sister
so i enjoy you know cooking things to take over to her house or
well not really right now i keep thinking when the kids get bigger and i have a little more time uh i might take up there's i'd love to cross-stitch i think cross-stitching's so pretty but i have never done any
but you know i can't even remember how i did it it's been so long since i did it but
oh it was a real pretty rug and i thought well i could use this as a gift or something you know and oh it was so it's beautiful but i did not realize how long it took and i got about three two thirds of it done
and then i had well you know i'd eat like at lunch at work we'd have a or whatever and then um as my kids got older and started you know recognizing what was going on and i thought this isn't really very good
just not doing anymore you know than they had to do and um just kind of letting everybody live
yeah just you know just small things that make it seem a lot more
yeah yeah yeah it is it's real nice and um i know our church does it and there are a lot of other churches and they are just like civic organizations that do
and you know doing the best they can but again i don't know what i'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother you know uh that would be
yeah i know i know what you mean
they'll tell me they'll reminisce about childhood and tell me something that they did and then the next time i go it's the same thing you know but
right i'll tell you the people i feel the the sorriest for there's a a a guy at this particular one i go to that i think that he's really an intelligent person but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate
but the one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids i have a three year old and a six year old and they um
they want the children you know to hug them or hold their hand and so far my kids will do it just real easily
well i guess i'm um more traditional in that i don't like power power windows or power locks because the people that i know have who have them always seem to have trouble with them
somehow i just think you know i like the idea
i don't know whether they think by
you know i mean i suppose if you were a a more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up
i'd like to know that the people who had them at least knew what the responsibilities were whether they followed them or not you know at least there's the moral issue that they they knew better
oh that's too bad i think the you know there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like but maybe not the you you know the men's trip but some other you know a nice tent on the the shore of a lake and
i guess the i get the and that is pretty big newspaper and i think that's
right i think that you know we've we've resolved the issue and that's what we were asked to do
i don't look at it as a threat in the same sense that that i think this question was meant what about you
and uh becoming was becoming an adult so i don't know how the would cope with it a
um i guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner cities of
i don't know what uh i suppose
i'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory
you know there's there was garbage on the corners when i got there and there's garbage when i left but i mean this is just a different uh cultural aspect i mean the trucks don't come daily and and you really don't want the garbage in your house so
uh you know i think there's something about being able to to claim um
well no i think i think there as i recall in my son's class there were were an awful an awful lot of minorities minorities yeah and uh of all of all varieties and
no i i haven't had had good luck with that company uh i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail probably
i guess because i never experienced it and it's not because you know i'm rich or anything it's just uh a mental concept that i have
but it sounds like you know you you learned from it and you're coming out of it all right
well it sounds good you know like i said it sounds like you're you've really got it under control
yeah and like i said once once it it happened i couldn't because my son's tuition came due and i guess i had you know not really counted on it quite
and you know but still i mean i figured i didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them
yeah i suspect that you know thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and you know the amount that i know they buy i guess probably a lot of them are
but but once i suppose you you prove yourself by paying this off next year you'll be in very good shape
and um actually there's one um woman in our i don't know what you'd call it uh institute who is a manager and i mean in a sense
it's it i suppose in a since i was surprised when they told me they majored majored in engineering i don't know why i but i don't know that many men that have majored in engineering either
oh dear you know well i mean it it's an interesting topic yet i must say it's not one that i've given a great deal of of thought to but um
yeah actually in a since i suppose when i was hired into the government um at i was taken advantage of
and and that's true that you know sometimes other people get get higher increments
so i figure you know nobody must uh nobody must like it it must be a rotten job for everybody but i know some people thrive on it
you know be there short times and then later on when he was you know i mean this we're talking about uh i went back to work and or taught some some classes like a week after he was born
oh i in my opinion it's even then i mean uh kids need you
yeah no i i think that certainly there is a role uh for this type of help and and as long as one can can supervise it and and you know make it work
no no and i didn't mean so you you assumed right
that's right that's right and you know i mean i was thinking it just you know my complaint would would be um that i think that
and i guess you know when you stop to think of it these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives
well no even families that don't have child care i mean you know when i think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year and i'm sure she spends at least that in clothes plus you know fast food every day and out to lunch every day
but among you know people i know i don't see a great you know there are those people who have have had serious questions all along and you know are sort of pursuing it but
either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code so that you know two doctors could balance each other out
and and maybe arriving late or something like that you know how how they enforce the rules
well that's it last year i think it was you know my peonies were were budding in and you know there was no way that was going to make it and sure enough you know we did had really mild weather until
and from what i saw the game looked impressed me a lot but my brother watched it on and said that was just having an off night and if that was an off night i'd hate to see what his uh good night
that's what i hate to say it but i hate i do
where maybe a physics professor he my professor was a physics professor and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background in physics at the high school level
and then when uh evaluation committees came through they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones telling them what they need to do to fix up this building and this and this and this
yeah well i mean cases like that they should i mean if he's gonna be drastic somebody has to be drastic back
really well well i guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun i mean
that's true i mean i don't know whether i'd stay in prison or not or
and i've been i haven't they won't let you on death row but they'll let you look down the hall you can't see any prisoners and it's kind of a weird feeling i've been they took us around on a tour you know and i went got to walk in the gas chamber
and it's it's kind of a weird feeling knowing you're sitting there saying like people have died here it's
i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend i mean why they can not just accept you know competent women i i have never been able to understand that i guess it's fear i mean what
are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just don't go to a new car you know whatever and i said
and so everybody's saying you're kidding you have two cars the same and i said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again
i said well we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it and it's an eighty five
and so i said hey this was a cinch we've paid for the car and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on
uh unless we we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell you know uh we were going up to a larger one
that's what i do you clip recipes and you save them forever and you never really use them and then so every so often you weed through them and think where did i ever put that recipe
uh reading the magazines hoping i would get more from it and it was just above my head without having someone there to
when i bought the computer all of a sudden i was receiving them for some unknown reason through the mail i think they all said thought well we have a live one she'll subscribe but they were wrong i never got into them but uh okay
well you know we went there once in fact we had been in and we were on our way home and we were driving and we said let's go to so when he said well this year you know i have a week there on a
a project he's going to be and then i said well i'll go along i hope it's swimming season because it wasn't a tremendous thing not amount of things to do that i wanted to do there
well i really i think travel when i heard my topic today i thought okay that's my favorite that's my favorite because
well and one of my very favorite is um that i would have to say we both end up going to um probably once every maybe year and a half
no i don't know we got the we got the question and i thought oh this is gonna be interesting uh two bits i'll get a man to talk to because they get stuck doing it all but although i do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work
ooh that sounds i've tried it and then i have it here on hand for about a week and all of a sudden it dawned on me wait is this totally imitation and then i found out i went back to the store and they said it is a fish product
so therefore you really don't have a very long life you know once you buy it i thought so you know they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is you know
that's the that's the thing i hate most about entertaining is thinking of what i'm going to serve i said i can make it in no time it's trying to think
well this is what everyone has said they said it's okay for you because you keep a real neat kitchen and i said yes i decided it looks better in and than it does in practicality
with all the everything through ready to serve because with the open area you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess like you said so you have to have the picturesque kitchen you know right out of the magazine
educate i think his name was became the drug czar uh for uh uh he was going to focus on it
and i and i imagine it's it you know it just feeds upon itself when when we have this sort of violence in society people want to it conditions people to it and
uh you have to emphasize it has to be even uh magnified to attract people's attention i guess to have them spend money on something like that and i am sure that it does form role models for young for young men and young women and
yes yes well i mean i i guess so what i wanted to say and i stopped uh i do not know i got diverted was uh that
huh and i do not know if i have solutions except except to you know i am sort of a a an advocate of
that that's right i think so and and i guess if it comes to um to magazines i don't read i used to when i was younger i subscribed to and and i have seemed to
uh actually collecting all this all the time and and profiles are given i understand uh i read the other day that uh these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone
and uh a and in the end now i mean they've tested they've spent forty million dollars and they've found uh i think uh in pilots anyway of something like uh
i guess i feel bad because uh not only that but in some of the instances like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints i mean what what what happens if you say no you say no then you're excluded and i doesn't seem the courts
well i mean it it just take that that step now where where now we feel there's a need to do that and the next thing you know then
well i guess um i'll start out and that is um i don't know what section of the public school system they're talking about whether it's the first eight grades the high school or colleges i have mixed views on all three of them
is the fact that uh many of the inner city and uh i guess what we'd call uh ghetto or poorer districts including rural districts
i think if i was going to fault it now if i'm i'm looking to carry on a conversation
that way i think there's a couple of things that really bother me i think when i learned the other day uh uh that uh the average the average now watches seven point two hours of television a day
they read well they do everything well but i mean i think that's a
no kidding oh i yeah i guess i could i can understand that oh i'm a product of the public school system from fifty years ago uh maybe not that long ago but and um and so i
well that that that's that that must be then then if that's uh i think we both agree on that then then then then a parent parental involvement has to be there and i guess you got to take them away from the tube also another thing that i have another
i read i also read i we're getting off the subject here a bit but i do want to add this to that because i was quite interested in that myself but i read where the reason that he had to do this in the sprint events is that national television wouldn't pay
i would think so you know uh i guess it talked about all types of pollution i happen to read just read something the other day
yeah i know in there's no place you go that isn't air conditioned and i do quite a bit of business in and
yeah unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately though i think the oil companies have lied to us for years
so we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left or there isn't and uh and uh i
um i guess my feelings are that uh we almost have a universal health care system uh to a great degree except that now i read where we've left out about thirty four million people
and um i don't know exactly how we're gonna cover many of these people because i'm sure that some of them uh don't uh don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves so uh i have a feeling since i have
have an emergency when i'm say in or uh that i'm automatically taken care of i mean i don't even have to pay
well i uh uh i know it i have a solution you see uh my my solution even though i'm rapidly approaching the uh
well i don't know uh we'll see how that goes i think that was just a regulation that was up for comment but we'll see what happens
well listen uh i think i've i've exhausted my uh self on at least i've blown off steam of the way i feel about it
i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i make a fair amount of money and uh the taxes that i pay um i guess as a as a general statement i feel i
uh i i'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area
uh uh with the with the great expenditure expenditure of effort and time there but i guess overall because i guess i'm not associated with what ghetto schools and and uh
whether you're a veteran or whether you i don't even know if you have to perform community service or unless uh or or you promise to even do something in the future i think that uh the
would give many people who i think i i think i perceive the fact at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their
but i guess to get back to the main topic i don't know whether i pay too much taxes i
in taxes they tell me when i sit and talk to people there they tell me they
one one of the reasons that we could get uh one of the reasons that it is lower in the is that mostly we hold it on knows why we hold it on and then we further complicate it by saying you know we'll keep the polls open until eight o'clock
uh that's almost a fourteen percent turnover every you know if you compound that that uh if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote
in any case they say that uh there's a definite trend uh well you know toward candidates using negative voting it's the only way that you can use television effectively
well it uh well i don't know is it working i mean that's that's the question i guess the question also is that we discovered is that they don't throw rascals out everybody seems disappointed but they don't throw the rascal out their own rascal
he should address those problems and if there needs to be a change in a period of time why what was so funny about it is that i guess that it happened so rapidly you know he knew it he actually knew it and being associated with government he should be held up to the light for that and maybe he will
well i don't know if they have higher turnouts overall i don't think has i think has about a seventy percent sixty five percent turn out
no i think the high there's a higher percentage in in certain areas of voters i don't know about you know
in some states i i i don't know uh i should imagine from what i read uh uh is like every other state it it's faced with uh
i don't know what we'd replace it with
i mean it so so i guess our population has grown some too but there there definitely is uh uh you know to me the one of the worst things that could ever happen uh from what i read and see and understand i mean i don't think i could handle prison
the ability to ask that but i i would think i if i did anything i'd protect the juror from
i thought to myself how did how did they only i think they only found uh found him guilty on one count which was uh not even which was a class something felony which was not even punishable
and they i believe that they have the right to know if you're using a a dangerous substance
well people tend to take the first amendment out of context which which means you know i could do anything i want to and you can't stop me and you know
i listening to a radio talk show today at lunch time uh i do not know if you listen to him or not he's on but uh there there's a fellow that had called in and was
some of the things he was just some of the things that he believed in some of his morals for instance uh they asked him if he spanked his kids and he said discipline and people i guess they confuse confused discipline with punishment
you know and just it seems anymore that uh if if you have
that people come down on you it's like you know hey everybody has to be free to do their own thing and i disagree and i think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime
how how many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between you know what you see and how you i mean what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do
and you know they've they've got a lot of the tools to do it but doggone if they can't just put it together uh you know they got the quarterback there in who's just you know phenomenal but he he's too streaky it seems
well that that says a lot for the for his ability though i think for i mean you know
i've kind of gotten out of the habit myself i mean it's i guess what i do now is i play softball right now that's about well right now i'm on two teams so it's four nights a week but uh
yeah i think my wife has some
ah uh i don't know to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there and workout and then drive back
yeah oh no yeah there there's no no question the the end result is great and i i mean i enjoyed you know we when when i was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired you know
well i don't know there you can get well depends on what you consider expensive i mean you can get real high powered stuff now
boy i tell you if i could bring a computer home and do stuff here i'd get all kinds of stuff done phone's always ringing and
and then you know so i eventually got it all paid now i carry one i have a gas card and a card and i never use them unless i need to
i don't know what she was making forty five dollars a month i think
you know i think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course i feel kind of weird about that anyway i think if somebody shoots somebody they ought to be shot so
yeah well and the they're actually a necessity in life you know they're not you know not everybody needs a gun but
you know like i told him you're a little bit young for a gun let me go out here and you know we'd start with the gun deal you know so he started with the gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows and i took it away from him i said now
i understand i can imagine you all have much trouble up there with insects or
i don't know what they're called
i don't know what they call them but i'm plagued with those things down here and i haven't figured out i even called the nursery either though see
they're like a water bug of sorts i don't know what they called them yeah yeah yeah when when you touch them they roll up
well i think i don't know how your schools work back there but we support our schools here with property taxes
you know each child has to learn at his own rate they can't keep force feeding things to each other and
yeah and see when i was a kid growing up and going to high school if i wanted to take a little electronics course i had a electronics course i could take but we lived out in the country and we didn't have all that
i have a hard time inventing shots you know let's go around this tree and you know try a slice through a hook here and i can't do that so i i finally got out and i've been watching quite a few videos i
and then when i come out here i just kind of let it go and then one of one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if i played golf i said well yeah you know i've got my clubs but i haven't swung them in quite a few years
twosome or threesome you know they're always friendly sure come on out you know and they don't mind if you make a mistake they don't mind saying well you know let me teach tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or
and when you know when i first got back into it i used to get mad because i knew i could do something and i didn't get it done you know and i just well i need to slice this ball around here i naturally slice anyway
well you know they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers
okay now they don't understand that you know maybe he needed fifty dollars so he held up the seven eleven
ethnically you know but you could do it you could probably get it a little closer but then there's another thing that i disagree with in is sometimes you have a jury of six and sometimes you have a jury of twelve
and i don't know why they do that do you have any reason do you know of any reason why they do that
and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner and i know yeah but i know families myself that have three and four children in that don't make that much
you know because they you know like you say these guys are in jail and they're working they're getting paid but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from or beat to death or has nothing you know our our victims are victimized period and the law has no
yeah because well the see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime the jury gets to see the whole trial as does the judge but you know if if they figure there's
shall we say sympathy you know he did this but you know why did he do this is there is there a basis for it
yeah well they'll get at it sooner i guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later they
you know they have we tried to have a aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that i have and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans
you know if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure they'll save them for us there no there's no problem there but what do you do with them in the meantime now i don't want a can a garage full of cans
mediocore mediocre expensive it wasn't really that expensive but it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something
you don't know who you can trust and who you can't
you know all my children excel they're they're really good and i guess no he learns from the older boys too but
you know where where we sent the first few years was there was different teachers all the time you know some
well you're here i guess i'll watch you when i get time you know maybe i'll clean my house maybe i'll cook you lunch maybe i won't
better than we did you know he gained he actually gained from it you know sure we gained from it because we were allowed to continue our employment and
um a good actor i think uh do you see
yeah we've got tons up here but i don't know how do you feel about your game i guess that's a good question
i don't know i have i can get get it within like you know four or five feet or something but
you know i go to a i have a club that i belong to that you know one of the girls travels quite extensively and she said well my children have two parents you know why not
an in the work force in certain jobs it's you know and you hear some people say you know well he's a man he he he needs that salary
and what i'm i'm curious i know why i love a stick shift why do you why did you want one
yeah boy i tell you what i sure hope they don't pass something like that
well i tell you um i remember every time it seems like we turned around they're adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline
well i heard it that i heard it that time
i can't remember the guys name
a cousin so uh uh but anyhow we got uh we got a nice uh picture and it came in an envelope that says with so we've got to uh try to get out there and see that one
i guess i guess i can intellectually uh kind of come to grips with all of that but you know emotionally i have a real difficult time believing that uh
that's right but i think uh actually uh in in trying to follow uh you know the over the years i think uh uh they used to have a um
but i guess uh when you have a whole bunch of uh professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes
i tell you what i there's the still you know still to me are the you know
so i don't know but i don't know who won and uh i don't know who do you normally pull for the the or
i was i always wondered that you know i i will take a look at the individual score you know in the individual stance in the
i think playing and i think they're really giving them a run for their money
i tell you what i guess it's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy
oh i don't know did you ever play much basketball
you know and it was uh it was funny i tell you i saw i saw a guy i don't remember what his name was but he got on the elevator and he had his swimsuit on
and uh i made some comment and uh he says yeah he says i weigh about uh uh two hundred and forty pounds
what do you think they're they're gonna be able to make it this year
but um yeah so that's what i'm going to be cooking you know i thought i would have like an um salad first and um then just something for desert you know bread and wine and cheese stuff like that
yeah yeah a lot of people think though that i've talked to about it think that it's you know a lot of hard work and i said heck it's kind of easy
so i'll say okay you guys are experimental i want say how this is going to turn out but here we go and usually i'm i'm pretty good about it
you bake the cakes and then just i guess because you know i don't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it like you know some a professional would i try to i go real slow and you know it's a little time consuming but it's really worth your effort once you see how you do
some different hints you know and the different things the different kinds of frostings you can make you know and i have a book an it and you know all of the different you know decorating tips an things like that
and that i couldn't watch and but you know you could tell when it was coming
so i predominantly wear flat shoes um you know in the winter i wear sweaters in the summer i you know i like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that
they their attire is always the same you know suits or slacks you know jeans whatever and um but i'm really the only woman i guess at work that does that but seems to work for me in fact i just bought or i just got a new outfit as a gift that um
that you know you can just pop your cans in and near the machines they have places you know for your paper you know i keep a uh little box at my desk
um-hum and i'm sure you know in the near future i would think they would be coming out with more you know i've seen a you know a definite trend you know towards more recycling everywhere you know even at
right i think i think it is getting more you know advertisement
you know where you get around the edge
oh oh oh oh i know what you're talking about um scaffolds that's it
you know since it's a one story but we did uh like two heavy coats over it but in in in that way you know you're assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it
that's good i never really thought about that but uh a good turn over would be sort of nice course if you find a place you like and you works out that no one else likes it would be sort of sad to see it go under
we have a lot favorites here uh in and of course we've got to call on you know and there's all sorts of things down there one thing about is that there are a lot of traditional restaurants where you know it's
and uh most food always leaves me hungry for some reason i don't know what they say about i'm always hungry after a meal uh
and so you know you tell them what you've eaten and what you drank or whatever and they figure out the bill for you and you're lucky if you get change usually they they take your change and throw you a couple of mints in your hand and say thanks you know
yeah a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there and that's what he said was that you know it just wasn't something that people had down there they put pools and garages on but uh no basements
so you know you really can't afford i could never afford a house inside the beltway that's why we came out here this is called the the the country you know with only you know maybe twenty miles total from twenty five
it almost seems like the attorneys are doing it for the money or something because i mean the guy knows that
i mean they everyone knows they're going get not going to get out
i think so uh a lot of the the the other violent crimes i don't really feel that strongly about although you know stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole i mean
because they know that the judge you know if they find them guilty is you know has the the opportunity to sentence them you know for for the death sentence
that we made i guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy and that was um
and uh you know they had you know meatless meals you know my dad wouldn't know what to do
yeah we used to do that um my mom used to go crazy every until my dad like blew up you know after after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the she stopped doing it
uh-huh we always we had that bread that was uh um you ever seen the the starter bread i can't remember what it's called they call it the um bread here but uh it's made with you just leave leave it out
you know and you let it spoil sort of yeah you know
not taking advantage of our you know of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us you know uh i mean we could direct the government even more than we have been i don't think we've been doing too bad
i don't know really what's going to happen
put it this way i think no i think the people are revolting themselves and we're
i don't know could be the the economic still you know the there's the poverty level is certainly uh you know much worse in the countries
i mean you can say that about too i think it has something to do with the poverty level because is certainly not a uh country and yet
and i've been sort of disappointed how that they they say literacy rate has gone down you know
yeah i uh i i i feel that way when movies are like blown up out of proportion you know usually people tell you how good they are and you always
but uh so this uh i guess are into the slapstick i guess so they would like yeah
there saying oh well you know the the people can't afford it
um i don't know exactly what the size of the juries i know one of my friends was uh uh brought up for jury duty for and he only heard very you know type cases
for people to to commit the crime uh to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away people have i don't know they just don't care any more the benefit i guess of crime outweighs what the deterrent is you know people that
yeah and the opposite was true of me uh after the case was over i was like somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way they did you know it was like well pictures isn't good enough we want to see i don't know what they wanted i mean
they want the guy to i don't know i mean just because you feel like he was being kicked on which he certainly was
that's true you know a lot of people uh uh i think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the the uh the party type followers the guys that uh
they'll just say oh well you know the have this election we'll see you in four years
you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country so they they don't come out turn out to vote and they're the ones that uh you know really know what's going on have the experience and seen you know how politicians can you know screw up or whatever
i guess they were doing it i was like well i don't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes so i
um-hum or it could be like the draft where you know before they draft you they take you you get a physical anyway so when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical and if there's nothing physically wrong with you then you're drafted it doesn't matter how rich you are
like this thing this is a pretty good idea i didn't even know they were thinking about it i wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone somewhere is really uh thinking that uh it'd be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service
i don't know no i don't
yeah well he's gotten a good mix i i was saying because i've like i said i heard some other people talking they've talked to different people in different states and stuff
yeah the only difference was that the government said okay if we're going to support this smaller country then we're going to support it a hundred percent and we're going to consider ourselves against in war against these people as well
yeah i don't know if they uh i don't know if they have that resource or not
really made the whole thing more uh visual and you could uh read the things in the history books and understand what they said when it was like we need food we need to raise food quickly because this this place gets very cold very soon
uh ten o'clock here in so that the only reason i'm home is because i'm home with a cold and the wife says well you need something to do talk to the guy on the phone
oh they're wonderful i love them i have some music i mean like i said that that's pretty varied
oh yeah and you know what i like the most about him is i've gone to see him in concert and he always he looks like he's having fun
i mean some people sing and they have their faces all contorted like it hurts them or something
the weather is uh this time of year has actually been kind of unusual i've expected it to be colder until you know what we've gotten last couple days
well and they've had uh you know usually in they get their snow in and uh
i know i did oh i know i did i know i did course i know i watch my thirteen year old play now you know and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body
what yeah well that's what it takes you need you need to play that often if you're really gonna get the handicap down
yeah well i read recently here they say if you're playing if you're scoring well you should play more
so but i've the one iron is something i've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that i should pick one up and try to start apparently they're very difficult to play with but with practice i would imagine you could group that swing too
yeah and i suppose they all have the balloons
involvement outside of work um i would never i would never have a problem with anyone testing me but i can understand why people would object so i guess uh i guess uh i'm kind of mixed on it still at this point
that's absolutely right it it uh i guess it all comes down to uh you know a a definition of uh how much out outside activities affect your work and uh
yeah i know of some people who did uh it was it was indirectly related you know they could always come up with other reasons but it it had a lot to do with it just uh the the whole attitude because it's really uh
you know if you hired me i'll be you know supposedly you agreed with a majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so uh you know let's let's stick with that original trust i guess huh
i guess i guess what i'm trying to get at is if it if it if it does help
i don't know if you know the it's it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation i don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much
um-hum absolutely and that i don't know if uh i don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too even even if you
penicillin well penicillin's not on the list but you know yeah i think you understand what i'm getting at it it can still show up and it can still flag as a positive and and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent
you know uh as a country the uh i think our hands are tied as far as as as any further involvement until the sanctions it in fact it really was to begin with
i just i heard a comment on the radio this morning that uh you know it it gets to a point where uh
you know there there's there's a complete different set of values um there's there's different value placed on human life and uh right down the list you know possessions and and everything else and uh
yeah well that that's that's the key you know whatever whatever works for you and uh
and i'll find i'll find something as i'm going along something not related like like uh i've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they they really didn't match
i you know i i don't want to put a price on it but i just feel like we're every every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house you know every every time i do something a aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home and
i tell you i started i guess the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when i was in college
eventually i get people to come and visit me in and then i'll show them that we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home
oh it is it's it's a lot of fun especially especially if you can find somebody that's uh that's got the same level of interest that that seems to be the hardest thing well about that's that's that's true of any sport you know if you want to play tennis or
you you know you you get stuck you get in a rut if if you do play a lot but you play with the same people you you aren't going to learn anything uh after after a short period once you learn everything they've got to offer then uh
i keep i keep rationalizing well you know i i can do it i i just got to do it all at the on the same hole and and then it'll get better and you just keep going and in the meantime just enjoy what you're doing and
it seems it seems to uh respond real well it it she's she's picked up a lot of things uh just just by uh teaching by force i guess is what i'd like to say
you know they're they're getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty a hundred and seventy five thousand dollars
but yeah that's there isn't there's an awful lot of things set up you know just any anything you want to do like like you say it can be uh
having them to work on that carburetor i mean they get they got everything tuned up right you know but they we got i got it home and uh
finding anybody i can trust like like you say it
but uh it it's it's real stressful to try to find anybody that i think's going to do me right and and uh you know have an idea of what's going on
then it's experience you know you can you can look through a a book or something like that and get an idea of how to go about it but
and uh it it's a little it's a little disappointing sometimes that you start to realize what you're breathing
it the whole idea is not to not to push the limit too hard i guess let let the you know let the natural natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible
yeah well that's it you know i i i think we both agree it's it's one of those deals that uh i just think there's a lot of other problems right now and uh we've done a lot to take care of it
because he said uh i've got i've got a dozen different varieties and
well i know exactly how you feel
that's that's uh that's going to be good and interesting for the kids even even cartoons um you you know you you watch uh you watch some of the cartoons and
that's i'm glad you said it and i didn't have to but that that that's the i feel the exact same way i sit i sit and watch some shows and uh and i'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show ah it's you know why do you do this to yourself
you know things like that but i don't i don't follow any team i i i check the scores the next morning and i know how everybody's doing and that suffices me
yeah no i don't know if there's any any series or anything that i pay attention to i try to watch once in a while
you can tell they they they pick up the words every once in a while
that the legislature said hey we got to do this we got to do this we got to do this but they forgot to put in the state budget
you can have the car uh uh checked at uh an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they don't have any financial interest in it
well what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for for three or four years and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it
i hadn't heard whether it's gonna rain or not
in front of them and you don't have to i know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families
yeah i mean we're we're taxed on taxes and um
uh i don't know how we're going to do that right away though but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is
so that i don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education system
and uh i think i think it's going to have to have it's patchwork
or he's singular i guess you know you know how they can make any of any single one of them in a movie to be a super
and even on those type they don't show what you expect
i'm not sure i can't remember been a while since i've seen it he he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings
uh if if that is that the second one follows the first i don't know if they have the uh
oh i expected those i mean i mean they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there i think
course there too you never know what the weather's going to be when you start getting over to
it's easy you said the magic word there drugs
i know i i spent thirty four years in education here in the area and in nineteen fifty one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school
to the forefront and people are finally taking some action against it and to think we've we've neglected the value of voting
you know they they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote
um but it just really depends on the weather and my mood and then you know obviously when i'm doing anything that i'm in front of people or or making presentations teaching whatever i'm going to dress up more
showing too much leg i don't know i wouldn't want to wear a mini skirt to work i have seen a few people do it though but they they weren't overly short and they weren't overly revealing they were pretty much in good taste but um for me i just
you know your boss doesn't come up to you and say now remember tomorrow you have a meeting so you'd better wear a suit i mean they they leave it up to you and your judgment to to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have
sometimes when your in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and you're not you know maybe you don't uh can't get as comfortable to sit down and you know like when i'm writing training material i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day
do you now you say your you go to school
and so he thought surely that i or i would have bought a hot line to know if he ever skipped school which of course was not the case and i wouldn't have checked on him however uh there are there are points
uh i listened to more than one parent say i don't know what this child wants i'm working two jobs they each have their own television they each have their own telephone they each have their own rooms they each have this they each have that
and then you know uh for for for no real you know uh uh direct reason i guess uh we we get into uh uh a really good relationship for a while and then
yeah yeah yeah and and he really i don't know he he he's kind of a fan anyway but he was but before he saw the movie he said he was like disappointed that would do this i'm like oh come on
and to make it believable i mean i was i was believing it i don't know about anybody else but i was it was great
and if the criminal chooses to have a uh three panel judge uh a three judge panel i should say i think he can have that rather than trial by jury
yeah i do think that that uh i do think the jury system works but i'd i also feel as you said that the original concept of the jury as it was originally setup
and they had he had to go through all of that if in three days to get excused from that jury to be with his wife on the birth of the twins and uh you know some of it just seemed rather extreme
do programs and tell them that we need your help and you know uh uh volunteer for such and such a time and you you have a choice of where you wanna go and and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it
but i think let's see the teams that were there last year were
let's see but i think i think the need to go and i think the will go
that you can bid on that stadium last night on the news i heard they said you could you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you
well you have to you know you have to give a lot of credit for he he said that's what we were going there to do and he did what what he said and he did pull out before it got any further than that where where it would have turned into more of a police action
and start addressing some of the other issues i think we could take care of everything and quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world you know who just end up using things against us later on anyway
and i think i guess in in uh ironic way a lot of good came from the war toward this war because like we we said earlier that you know the a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of of that war and and
and i you know that nobody says because you're supporting the troops that you're you're supporting the war you you have to support the people that are there
and i don't even know what they're doing for themselves you know
he wanted to direct it he wanted to act to star in it you know he he enjoyed the story line and i think he just really wanted he really wanted it whether it
that's what i'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say when you have kids of your own you'll understand
well i don't know i mean i don't know what you think about this subject i the
i had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the the sentencing to uh to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that i've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while we was waiting for them to find somebody and i don't know that that's not a good idea
but i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves i mean we and and it would i know people say oh it would be cruel to you know pull our aid from these other countries and and maybe so so tell them you've got five years
that one person has total control you know and i always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around and if you get one bad apple there's are at least other people that can see it they can watch and i just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less
you know how can you help depending on the day care center you know you got to
yeah yeah i think that's really important and we've already started about you know i mean how young can they start ball and soccer you know i mean i just you know we both think of that that as just so important to get him involved in stuff like that and
you could hardly wait i mean he's he's so much fun now he's really he's really starting to get lots of fun and i can't wait until stuff like that starts happening you know and you know we did the egg hunts which was really the first year he was really able to
and to know what we want know what he was doing you know and enjoy it and it was so much fun and we went he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant and he got up on this elephant all by himself and i couldn't believe it they had so much fun
you know like a year old it was ridiculous and she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other you know so its i mean she's
she knows what she's doing all the teachers like like about half the teachers are degreed teachers and oh it makes a huge difference
so it's a little high but but it's you know like it's where where he was before i was only paying sixty three so i mean there was there's quite a little jump there but you know i looked all over
you know your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money you know and i have peace of mind where he is and some of those other places i wouldn't have
well personally you know i think you know of course i'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package and i think that uh we've probably got one of the best around you know besides
one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the that is offered and i think that is just a a fabulous one so i don't know if you participate in that or not but
and then one of the things that we talked about with her was you know the need to save for our son's education we have a two year old you know and and you know we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen you know we have to do that now and and uh
they have a way that they can figure you know what you know and he's two now in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college this is how much it'll cost you know and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to it's
really scary and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like fifteen between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a oh you know six percent interest rate to be able to have
you know money for his college and that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is is you know about fifteen hundred dollars a year so i guess it you know in that way at least we know that that's taken care of you know we we can worry about other things so
that's right that's right well that's what she said to us she said now do you all want him to go to a a state college or a private college and
so i don't know it's it's i don't uh it just amazing it amazes me how much the the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years i just don't know how anybody's going to do it
well you know you know offers some good stuff and then i think there's i mean i think there's some negatives but there's going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go i have
you know i expected to go and you know drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later and you know she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little it was great you know
you know it just it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home you know she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer you know so
he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes and there they went you know and he said you know i can balance my checkbook in seconds you know because it's all in the computer you know so
that's exactly right he said you know he said used to be i said i always sat looking for those you know he said this way there isn't any you know it does it for you so
i'm going through right now i'm you know going part time in the evenings and you know i do yeah everything has to be typed i mean they require it you have to type it you know and
i don't know what they used to do before they
that's right you know i remember when i was working in high school you know i was working in an office and right right after i got out of high school i continued working there for probably another year
they did it right they did it right i mean they they yeah they sit there and they go is this really what i want to say and you typed it and that was it and now you know people just send it back over and over and over and over
yeah instead of knowing what they want to say before they ever they just you know play with it and which in a way is nice to be able to do but you know it it gets a little out of hand sometimes i've seen it get out of hand up here you know where
and on each letter what types of changes are they typos are they because i couldn't read it or people just change a like one word because they think it sounds better or whatever
well that's exactly right you know she keeps you know keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show you know look this didn't really need to be changed you know this is this is ridiculous and you know changing the word you know at this time to now
you know i mean that that's the kind of things that you know people that she's keeping and showing you know that this this this was a big waste of time it was a waste of paper it was a waste you know to change something like that so
so i know my father had a and and when we were in high school it was always fun we could um link in and i don't even remember now what it was called but you could link in and talk to other people talk to people all over the country you know
and like you have your own little code name you know and you'd type in hi how are you and they'd type back everything everybody and you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time and everything everybody said
it's oh it added up big well you know we my parents were divorced and so the time we were like visiting our father in the summer time you know so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it you know i'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations you know
i'm kind of like you i've never really gotten into it it's just a it's just a chore you know and i finally decided one semester i'm in college and i'm taking night classes and
and they were offering a a walking class where you you know you have to walk you know that like for every mile you walk and every so many minutes you get you get points you know and then you have to go in once a week and log your points so it's not like you can do the class like anytime you want you know
i think i think that has helped a little bit i don't know
well since you live close i don't know if you know um about what doing with recycling are you familiar with any of that
yeah i you know i read you know when they first started doing that in the paper and i read about that i was just praying that that you know that would be in our area because we've been recycling for quite sometime and
it was a real hassle and i'm going are we really gonna do this but you kind of get i guess into a little routine you know and it just becomes kind of is automatic now to to throw different things in different places you know
so i've just got you know we have a a pantry pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and i've just got three trash cans sitting in there you know and we just kind of dump things in each one as you know as we get them so
they do too and they're impossible to crush i mean you can't get them down to any size you know i mean you know you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag you know pretty easily so yeah you're
yeah yeah ha-ha well i was kind of hoping with you know do you work for
and you know if i know that they're gonna be there you know you you i try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up and if i know they're not
uh yeah and then during the week you see these women in the you know just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore you know
i mean i've never seen them do it without hose i mean they always have hose on but still it's they're shorts i don't care what you say they're shorts you know well i think dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway you know i
you know if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on but you know i don't know if they do or not you know i see a lot of the managers and they're in jeans so you know
uh there's a little thing at the bottom that it's like a call in survey that says you know do you think so and so and then you call this number and you press like one for yes and two for no
i really do i yeah it's going to take uh you know the the police i think i don't think can do it uh can do it alone you know
it's going to take uh it's going to take all of us getting together i'm sorry i'm trying to my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed it's going to take all of us you know getting together and just saying we are not going to take it any more
my gosh the only thing about the death penalty and and i know that that they try to be careful and they try to be sure but these people are on death row for like twenty years you know and you know if if
i don't i guess i mean that's may sound that sounds cold but gosh you know we're keeping you know we're we're keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row
no no and i don't know the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas you know well if you're insane enough that you can go
cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard then are you can can you be helped you know i have i have my doubts you know
you know these parents didn't know this the the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming let me in you know can you imagine
and my little boy is only is just a little over two and their little boy is like five you know so there's a big difference and they were playing in the back yard and we were getting ready to leave and i went out in the back yard to get and the boys were gone and the back fence was open you know
you know you'd have to climb like come over they'd have to come over the fence they could not open a gate you know and i still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there you know i mean if i don't hear him playing i mean i get up and come out and look out the window real often you know so
and i don't know what needs to be done you know it seems like there's no room in jails to put them in jail and when they do put them in there you know were i'm taking a business law class at night and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney and
so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases you know and he said you can pretty much you know if you ever get on a jury you know you're not told this but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess whatever you sentence them to they're going to serve about a quarter
they they'll serve they'll serve a quarter of it so if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years don't sentence them to fifteen years sentence them to a hundred you know because then they'll serve fifteen or twenty so which is really i don't know
and we're going to have to say if you commit this crime and if we're sure you commit this crime you are going to be sentenced to death period
period and do it you know and if you commit this crime you will be in prison for the rest of your life we're not going to say we're going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years we're really going to do it you know it's just the system has just
uh i guess what i feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it there's got to be something when when we pay so much for the for the debt
yeah well things like mailings they don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things they just think once they get there that they can do just anything you know they don't they don't try to uh to conserve
to know what what to do about some of this stuff i
that's why i thought well you know this is the time they need to put that into action into action and show they mean business that they've got to cut they've got to cut costs
you know it you just feel like it's out of control you feel like they do not have control of it and that and so then it just aggravates you you know you think i could spend my money i could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing
i don't really feel like i use taxes very much i don't know maybe i do more than i guess i do i use them in the in roads and lot of things but uh
no i just just a housewife i just heard about it and found it fun guess i like to talk that's all
came back from uh uh where we saw one of our sons graduate
yeah i think that's right i i can remember as a child you know nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where i wanted to go
and and when there's nobody there i always thought too that you know people worrying about going to work when their child when their children are little
yeah and uh he used to i used to come down stairs in the morning to feed him you know and i'd let him up out of the basement where he was sleeping and he would just dance around the floor and i just got
and you know like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that they're very much like uh well the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes
and he didn't he the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming when would drum he'd sit there and scrunch up you know like he was trying to protect himself and then he'd leave the room
see good enough you know and uh it's hard to tell what i'm doing and it's just aggravating oh i just thought of something we have to return all right it'll it'll come to us okay are you ready
in some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it they probably didn't know what they were talking about
now that's an advantage isn't it it really is i think uh uh there's a lot not to be said for credit but that's one thing to be said for credit it how it gets you some muscle where you need it
tape recorder you know so that i could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while and then also so that i can uh uh copy uh
uh i was recording and the next thing i knew the tape was chewed up in the thing
yeah no i think this is a i think this is maybe a name brand and i suspect that it's probably just a fluke you know i have the papers and everything and we're going to get just take it back but uh
yeah i think just uh just uh one of the major major i think it was a you know i don't i think it was uh
you know uh i've had i've known people who have had for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them well they may cost a little more but they don't have to take them to the shop every other day
you know and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that
yeah i think i uh i enjoy it sometimes and there's other times when i just get tired of it and
i don't know if it does to everybody he was
yeah well i think it's crime has gone got a lot worse in the last last ten fifteen years and maybe that has a lot to do with it
i guess when i was growing up it was it was still the ideal to get a get a home and buy house and those good thing these days you see a lot of people living in apartments
uh i don't know i think the middle class is shrinking and the uh
it's hard for me to say i hope it happens because i'd be one of those that gets caught but on the other hand there's a lot of injustice that needs to be be changed
i don't know i think we ran out of social social changes to talk about so
tell you what i'm losing you
i know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the
i don't know it's variety you know they throw in a little news and a little bit of other stuff it
it's it takes a lot more time to read something and you've got news bombarding you from everywhere now you know you turn on the turn on the radio
i find it hard to believe that people'll go back to reading over television i mean just given the way
they tell you what they want you to hear
yeah i know down here the school's are you know i don't know they rate i moved to and after living in and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country and
so you know i like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education you know you you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier
i think the schools today you know the public schools are just they're just overrun you know they don't know what to do there's too many kids and not enough teachers and too many kids don't care
about that but a lot of the industry up in uh you know the northern states is moving south and i'm wondering if that's going to have any effect you know on what you see now we're we're we're behind down here
i say we because i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years
well i know i'm in the you know the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the of the education i'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school
but that's i don't know i think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built you get people out of high schools and college junior colleges that don't have the background for an kind of curriculum so
yeah i think you know i like dogs but i think that uh i'm i'm kind of like big dogs big dogs and you have to have room for them
and i think you know when i was growing up we had cats cats
i think they just ought to you know start uh just go all all the way you know new products introduced or whatever you know start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts and you know people if they have to are going to learn to think that way
right it's kind of hard for me to believe that this this day and age i don't know when i was growing up we were taught the metric system in school i mean not not at first but by the time i was in fifth or sixth grade anyway
i don't you know i don't know i uh i work for we're all around the world you have to perform this conversion anyway
yeah i remember how big stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns and ours were in
yeah i think they you got the problem with all your cars are still
uh one picks up real quick and the other one doesn't and you're right they do get bored uh really fast if they already know what you're talking about
that's true the only i think the only thing that they would argue about that is that you know every child needs to learn every subject i mean that's that might be the only thing
and i mean it's so boring and i just hate it and i think why do they make us take this stuff i mean what does this have to do with getting you know a computer science degree or whatever you know
any way this this um school system thing i i tell you i saw something on the news oh
uh the the thing you know they said well we're giving them isolation time and this helps them to think
i mean they were they were called they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms they didn't call them closets but they showed these rooms on uh you know on the news and i mean they looked like a closet to me you know with a desk in it a real small
i said now what good does this i mean how is this helping i mean either way
and when the kids are in halls and stuff and if they're being really good i mean just being excellent they're not you know cutting up and so on they're just standing in line doing whatever they are supposed to they get one of these caught being good slips
well that's true i think i think really though i mean that's one thing that i mean my kids definitely get spanked when they need they need to be spanked
i mean i i think i wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child but you know that's just my personal opinion and that's not going to i mean i don't think that law will ever change
but i don't think i mean some kids don't get don't get spanked at home and some kids need to be spanked at home i mean don't you think
yeah they're not really that bad but i don't know like i said it's it's still not practical for me i have a hard time looking at cars like that because i think now there's no way i can do that
well okay i guess i didn't really consider that heavy metal i mean i i think when you say heavy metal i'm i'm thinking about like you know
nineteen seventy five or something like that and they paid like they they had it built from you know they they designed it and everything
that's always a good thing vegetable trays always go over so well because i think people get tired of eating junk i mean i think they like to have healthy stuff too you know it's
right that's true or even have you ever seen where they they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat i beat yep
i think i know what you're talking is it like a hand held thing yeah okay
that's really interesting i've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that's really neat
huh that's i've never heard of that before i've probably seen it though i mean when you described it
yeah i mean when you described it it sounded like something you know that would be around i guess
there's yeah there's a a few designs i guess i've done myself but not very many real simple ones you know i do i've made i made a little uh
i guess what i guess my
we have a fish tank so i watch the fish you know whatever i can do to keep myself occupied
and then usually after i'm done riding the bike just to cool myself down i usually take a walk you know and that just kind of gets myself uh gets me you know
i don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise you know so i have tried to just do stuff at home
what if you're already on one i mean yeah i mean when you go in there they wouldn't make you do theirs would they
um that was okay i i don't i guess i thought it was too far fetched but so many people said oh no it wasn't you know but i guess
hey that's pretty good no i guess like i say i just have i don't know i just have never seen any interest in him but
you know that it just doesn't even give you the effect i mean some of them are done good and they do scare you but um so many of them are just done real i don't know i'm not really into those
i was really impressed with that one i mean it was what i liked about it was that it was a new subject nobody had ever touched it before
i would think you know he might i mean he might could get hurt by a car or something i don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big you know but i don't know
that's i don't know this is just so hard it's just like i said we've had him for two years and he's never i mean he's he's gotten out
uh i i just knew today uh you know we looked at the pound and
and that we just went all over the place and i knew we were going to find him you know and when we didn't it was like oh no so i don't know
so i think that if somebody else picks him up i think that uh if he gets out he'll come back you know i really do because he knows exactly where he lives so
i know it's just like i said it's just so ironic that this would happen you know and i would get this this kind of a call yeah it just i know it's really strange but
well that's good that's one thing about cats though they're so small and you know they can get hurt a lot easier you know and then so that would make you really tend to worry about you know if they're not right there
they'll put their head underneath your hand you know it's that uh and most dogs do that i mean i don't know any that really don't i mean you know they know exactly how to get that attention you know they just
yeah uh-huh yeah the backyard it's real big too for him to run in and stuff that's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out you know because he got all this room to run in and
he dug a hole under the fence well see he did he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole and you know we we filled it back up
i don't understand you know because it's like uh he's got a good home you know he's got i mean we have two kids you know that just love him a lot you know it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out you know we just couldn't
yeah i guess that's yeah i guess that's probably true i don't think it's anything we did least i would hope not no i i know i mean he's always you know he really does have a good home i think that's what really
i don't know at first you know they seemed to be upset but now it's like um
you know and they i mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees and you know
it's really i can't believe that you know because they've got it all posted all over the place how much they're saving and how well yeah
i mean like i said they do a lot of internal advertising on that kind of stuff but i haven't seen anything
i know my kids um like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say oh look at that somebody is not saving the earth you know so i mean the kids i mean they're really trying to educate all ages you know and it's good to start the kids real young
you know it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things saying hey you know we're ruining the earth you know and now everybody is doing something about which is good
you know i think it's really catching on you know i i think that
um because like we were asking some people that live in um well are you saving your you know are you recycling and they said well we're not forced to do it yet so no
i've seen the sign that goes to there i've well i think i've seen it in the distance
and i didn't know what they were talking about it took me a long time they're talking about the viaducts
i don't know i haven't been as i'll tell you what i love to watch and this is not this is rarely on television but what is a lot of fun to go attend is this arena football
on a national and a local level why do you think the apathy exists i blame it to apathy
and i i think the you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news and by time say you get off work and go to vote you feel like it doesn't make any difference
and they don't register and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today they say well i would
yeah yeah i think well i know it's true you see a lot of that you know rally behind the female she may lose but by golly we're going to make a statement here
she said that i didn't said you know don't tell me what women can do
you know and i watched the news and i thought ha ha that's that's not i don't have anything to worry about i was on the plane heading back to before it dawned on me stupid you own property in
i i think they're they have they're working on something uh something in now
well i guess though where i would have a problem with it if i were on the jury
i think i'd probably do it but we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance it that's that's that's a real easy thing to say that oh sure i would but i don't know
well i'd i now i have a problem with this too i think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance
well my children are about in the same age bracket i think let's see the oldest
and there's four two girls and two boys and i think one of each experimented very slightly with pot and i think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge
he knows he has to and he knows he should and he knows and he knows but he hasn't
and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything but i don't know what i did to my knee i
and the doctor has had me on medication and she doesn't want me to walk she said that's you know while it's healing you're going to mess it up so i can't walk
you know i make myself do it and if i do it okay i don't love it
yes i i really hear that you know i think you know you're in
well i don't know if i know anything or not but i've i've got some opinions on it see those type of people that that have the most opinions ones at don't know anything
uh i think this me generation has gone far too far and the young people are overly impressed
they're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it now come on let's be realistic that's just not realistic
i knew that i had that much credit going in sometimes you know sometimes i would go over but uh
well i found you know i found in um
uh i i was anticipating you know my room would cost uh
expensive you know i want i want something that's serviceable serviceable something that i can use and uh and i and with the i have a uh you know and it's you know
it was just there was no there was no comparison uh the only thing that i find you know if i would have anything against it is that it still has that
i am not really crazy about driving i never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when i was young when i was sixteen
you know sports car racing i never
all along the gulf coast from i guess from to they have uh shark tournaments and you know there's part either as part of or separate from
that's why i say did you stay up late to watch this it came on after on nights here at least
i've had them for carpet cleaning i've had them for of course for you know real estate investments know you get uh
i think those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy
i think you i think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner
so she'll you know why are you cutting off the phone i might get an important phone call so
the house you know housing there is extremely affordable and uh compared to other parts of the country you know let's say compared to
so you can still get a get a a good good house for a very very reasonable price and i mean good i would let's say typical
on on something along those lines so you know it's you i guess you pay the piper but
what we would you know what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house say for example in on that house
yeah well i don't know i told my husband i said you go out some to work on the car it's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong i says you go pay to have someone do it
but i know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby um he does it believe it or not i wouldn't imagine why but to get out of the house away from his wife
because he's a seasonal worker he works in the construction and up here it's almost a pattern i mean you see your fathers do it then their sons do it what they do is they work construction then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter
oh that's good i guess they they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall um
um i don't know i was i have a tent and i slept out in it in the backyard and stuff but the thing thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything
but i don't know i don't know if i'm going to go
i don't know but that sounds like my kind my kind of
yeah that's what the when this subject was mentioned to us i said well i went gee that's all i use mine for is a word processor and i haven't used it since i got out of college and that was six years ago
because she needed it to do she just finished up her degree so i don't know if she's going to even use it anymore it's it was
well i know there there's a got to be a lot of uses but it's just you you have to have a need
very competitive i don't even i don't even know much money my sister spent on hers but i i just thought i it's it's going to be a waste she's not going to do it not going to use it
hopefully they'll promote good schools because i know the town that i come from the the uh the large plant has something to do with the top rated high school
yeah you hope well i think i don't know i just think it it's it's a duty of the parent to do that
i don't know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and to to see what they need and not overinflate it
yeah i don't know if i would do that to my child though but so hum pretty much though see i don't have any good ideas or
um pretty much and i and i don't know how they sort that but if if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i would i would have a recycling center
yeah i know what you're saying like well we have it at work we have a very aggressive recycling at work and i'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin see some people the recycle bin is on their way out
i think if some people they have they say well we're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these
if i brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home i don't want to be a selfish selfish you know a burden on anyone that's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through
yeah i know if if if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the the in-law apartment
talk about the crime and all that in the city it's just the kids have no morals and stuff that's the thing that will eventually you know if anyone is going to be saved it is having a good moral background
okay maybe maybe we're all set okay we'll talk for five minutes they interrupt at the end um yeah it says what you would have for a dinner party i just happen to plan one out for i'll tell you what i'm going to have um
i can find it well i have this new fondue pot and i was going to do basic cheese fondue
fish chunks and dip it in the fondue i don't know if it will come out
what i've been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something i make uh food kebabs take little toothpicks and cut up uh pineapple and strawberry
yeah you probably get this probably pretty sticky after you get done then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because you know when you scrape it it makes the water
i mean no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot i don't let that worry me and i get the milk lukewarm and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it and i have this thing it's called the slender blender
it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord and you beat this cornstarch right into the milk the milk you know and it does an excellent job or just hand beat it i guess you could use a hand mixer but
yeah but i still think a beater would do it good enough um the trick is to get the cornstarch
but um i my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard that's yeah so that's why i do that
well this is a good subject isn't it it it's something that you can really talk about um i don't know what we're going to do about it but it's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about
i don't know if that contributes to the problem
yeah like say now i would now me not even knowing anything about i would think that it's a pretty calm city
to do it yeah but you see is telling them rebel you know um uprise uprise and that's what they did
yeah i don't think the higher ups were thinking about what what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine they're going oh well it's not going to hurt us so we're just going to let them go
i don't know they it knew what had to be done and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it to you know the uh the go ahead to do it
i mean i feel really sorry for these people these people are middle class people just like us can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood and
and you knew this these people are going to come and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you of course you're gonna just gonna pick everything up that you can carry and you're going to run
well you know what i was hoping i was hoping was going to take a very um dramatic stand and invade
i'm kind of disappointed with the why they didn't go save save i mean i don't know if the i know the are their people but i don't know i think they have a bond with the the
so i guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work or do you or do you like to do it
boy i wish this phone would stop screeching
i don't see i don't think my phone really does that
i mean she she reads all kinds of books so i wish i knew more to tell you why but
but i don't think the vines have they don't really they don't have to be touching or anything like you say they cross pollinate just by bees
to uh you know if i want to grow a tomato or something in there i mean i guess it'd go for my flowers but
yeah i don't i don't i just don't think you i always thought i'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird but i don't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering
and i don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated
yeah this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch and i can tell you there's nothing around it cement foundation all the way round it not a shrub not a bush
and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we'd do
how to combat it i mean i don't i don't think uh ideally you know you need money to do everything so that's one thing that
like a big brother trying to keep the the younger kid you know tell him hey stay in school it'll get better you know so that your mom doesn't have a job and
yeah but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here i mean um they can deal with that scale
um-hum well but see i read an article about uh in about uh about and about his latest you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them
yeah the second one the blonde uh you know if you think about it they didn't really interact hardly at all i mean they were never partners
which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners you know and that that i kind of thought was good but um
yeah the it it it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married you know the minute they get married everything's supposed to be cut and dried and
and well of course another one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the character's uh
um see i have to take uh medication for a uh for for kidney transplant and i'm going to be taking that the rest of my life now you i don't know how that's going to affect uh
personally i think that's what i was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested
yeah i think so i think we i think we did pretty good
kind of gave me the impression of being a uh um oh i don't know a macho team you know they just didn't seem they seemed to think they were better than everybody else and and maybe they were but um i was real happy to see them get knocked off so
well that might have been what it was but i i guess the headlines said something about him you know that the you know released him or something i'm maybe i misunderstood what they meant
you know you you oh yeah because i mean yeah because i everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to you know to imitate them or whatever and and uh you know i thought he did such an excellent job of not
going that far now you know at the by the end he was looking more like a cop but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part you know he was he was trying to you know trying to get it but he wasn't there yet but you could tell
like i said i thought was a real good acting and writing job both you know because i think or directing job i think they did a real good job of that and um i think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop i mean you know he just yeah
you know the organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper but yeah that's exactly what i was going to say i keep i keep not doing it until after i'm there and then all of a sudden i'm saying i wish i'd bought these things
uh they uh somebody made an interesting observation now that i think back on it i'd say yeah i can't believe that either she was the only indian to have her hair done at all times you know what i mean you know
no i don't i don't get into that too much every every once in a while i will keep in in touch with maybe like who's in the top five of hitting or something like that but i don't get into you know how many errors somebody has or things like that
pure power hitter anyway i mean i don't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time i mean uh i think that uh that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it
but when you get two strikes on you you have a tendency you know you should you know shorten your swing a little bit you know if it's a perfect shot go for it but i mean you know the strike outs were a big problem for him and uh plus supposedly what i heard he was not much of a team player anyway so
having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you you know gives you one run obviously but i mean if you can't do it with men on base there's something definitely wrong um you know you you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs you know to to be able to
what they were you know what they were looking for in other words if if in training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do
um that's probably true well considering what i've seen in the last uh you know two seasons i'm beginning to agree with that yeah but i mean you don't have to spend the big money as far as i'm concerned to uh
to win you just have to spend it if it's necessary in other words if you've got a player on your team who's helping your team then keep him there don't let him go away you know and i think that's really what's been hurting uh uh the uh
you know that's one of the things that i think has done um i mean their you know their ticket prices are you know kind i guess as high as anybody else's but what somehow or another they attract
yeah like uh you know i think the one time i did it was on the the the crisis out there and everything that was had a great conversation but uh then they came off and told us we couldn't do it any more so
oh yeah i'd like to have one for the house too but sometimes my my husband my my husband says usually i work on the computer all day at work i don't want to come home and have to work on one too
first in for a while you know he had a he had a uh one of those what are they top secret things you know where he couldn't talk about what he did so
for a while but then he switched jobs i don't understand half the stuff he does and i have uh
yeah i know those two i worked
that's right you know it gives me a paycheck you know it's only like the works only you know three weeks goes for like three to four weeks three times a year
uh-huh will they let you take a computer home to work
yeah it is real nice you know i just deal with them on the telephone half the people don't even know who they're talking to
but i you know worked i know most of them well i can't say that a lot of people changed around there but most people know who i am but i don't know who they are you know
well i think we need to do more i mean i know i need to do more they have programs around where you can reach they uh
but i have a hard time of being able of separating you know having a place separating my trash and get all the cans from the paper and you know i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet so
you know it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it you know it's not always convenient to do it
you know occasionally we have some around but you know for other kind of cans just to it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that don't they
yeah i don't know what you know i haven't i'm sure they're probably doing that here some
uh-huh i think it's necessary i like it you know it makes i think it's good that you see these you know like boxes cereal they're now starting to make them you know the packages out of recycled paper and
i think if you know the cities locally you know they'd get more programs going so that you could do that it'd make it a lot easier so
we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home you know we have we try to spend like nights we call it family home evening and
you know have little lessons with them and you know just see count see how things are going in our family and
and it it's uh the kids just had a wonderful time there they you know you just pay that admission and then all the the the rides are free you know they of course they have all the little video games and you know those little quarter rides you know to
sometimes i just don't like everybody knowing everything about me you know so
no i never do my husband does at work just to get cash out but uh i take the checkbook so i you know i just if i need cash i just tell him and he gets it out and i don't even think i know my number
yeah i mean i get i get at least one or two a week people to you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i don't want it because i
i'd like to know where they determine that i'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line you know you've already been preapproved
so i'm um i just love to sew and uh you know i make i make a lot of my presents and
they those have been real popular with my family i've had them calling up and saying will you make me another one and
you know like if somebody needed a bridesmaids maids dress made i'd make that but that's about all the sewing i did i never had time for you know to sew myself a new dress or anything like that so
guess we can go ahead um well i guess you know it's you know since living in it's always so hot so in the summertime i just i wear lots of shorts so because i don't work during the day
i just have you know i just wear my you know my shorts and stuff like that i i don't go out and spend lots of money on uh different you know suits and stuff you know
yeah you hate to get rid of it because you know how much you spent on them
yeah i you know if i have if i know i'm having somebody come over to the house and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room i will put it away but
yeah and then with my kids they're always getting into you know they can't decide what they want to wear so they change their minds you know i know i mean my oldest is only four but she's
changes her mind two or three times before she figures out what she's going to wear so
yeah well that's it's been good talking to you to see somebody hear somebody that does the same thing i do because i tell people what i do and they just go oh how do you do that it's like it's easy you just do it you know
um i don't know i think i make things you know that i do things kind of simple because i you know i just have close friends over i make like lasagna and uh
oh yeah you can barbecue turkey if you have a big enough grill but my i cook my turkeys inside you know it buy you can buy smoked turkeys
you get to think you know i come from and it's basically the same same type of thing except for you do eat more the down here so
entertainment and then our our own fun money and just stuff like that and then we write down each each time we spend something we write down in a book and end of the month we tally it up to see if how close we've you know we we try to stay within a certain budget so
um it takes some it takes some dedication to do it but it it works out real well so
you know and then we have that you know if you can't stay if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have uh you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something and something unexpected unexpected comes up then you're not
uh-huh that sounds interesting we've never done anything we have you know just our our life insurance guy has come out you know and he's set up uh you know determined how much we need to
right yeah you you know if i would sell the you know if he something would happen to him i wouldn't stay in i would uh
you know i don't know what he would do but
yeah well it was nice talking to you tell me tell me where you're calling from
it's a real it's a real nice place to go and camp and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although i don't think i don't think the state of takes
it's it's just kind of nice i like the uh i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty
a lot of people don't realize you know they hear desert and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and
i don't know i guess uh i don't even know why i watch i guess i just wanted more news it's one of the few times i wanted
yeah i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably
so i don't know are we suppose to it seems to me it says you're supposed to talk for three minutes but i think we've been talking for three minutes and nobody has interrupted
so i know uh you know i know about this project so i got my students to sign up and uh apparently a number of them have been participating
i don't know whether i have any real profound thoughts about that i actually was was planning a trip to and i got warned off by
and and really i mean i think are when you say that even i think i mean i tend to think of and i just don't think of as being although i guess strictly speaking they are
and certainly you know knew that problem knew you know knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that
i don't really know um i grew up in and have felt like i was victimized by air pollution
i don't uh i don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals um maybe
i i don't know what we can do as individuals what do you think we can do
you you use um like your first couple of years you use personal computers because uh you know the software you know like it's easier for you to go and run a program you know through the disk
because um the grader can do it at home then as the you know as you go up higher like in your senior level you're doing projects which are are so big and you have to have so many people sharing the same data
due due to the fact that well you know i haven't tested the the two yet but i don't know if the software is as easily you know like you can manage it a lot easier than than the old one the old one you had to go pick a line
use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start and where you know with the mouse you do it you know like a hundred times faster
with you know with the what would happen is uh since the software that i had was it was basically you know you only see part of the page
instead of saying where did i make the error you know go back and forth and and you know you always you know the old ones you had to go out of your program load up um
it's like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they're not going to tell you you know they're going to spend more time on doing a a thing on a on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old than they are on anything else you know
i thought i thought like when it like when i was like in high school and junior high school i used to hate it
i hear no we're just you know it's like we just woke up we had a hangover and everything you know and so we just woke up and uh we're watching and i go no today we're just going to dedicate ourselves to watching golf
okay so i think i think what we should talk about is the the war um the war that just went on see i don't agree with it first of all i don't believe in war
and so when you know saw this they said let's take over the country which is a good idea
and the doesn't go in there and say listen they were uh you know named an independent you know state with a president and everything but we're not going to go into your country
and you know it's it was uh basically all based on oil because nobody actually like for example if uh let's say if uh you know took over you know i don't think anybody would care
there's there's something that that the did right which is say say you know okay let's kick him out of
but the thing is is that they they didn't go into into and say you know because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country you know you can seek seek asylum here and you can go there but no way are you going to rule ever again
no no i think i think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in because there's i mean there's like it's like there's no hope you know like what did you know like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life but where
but it's just it's just that uh you know it you know like the we just put our goals in different you know levels is like saying you know it's like yeah sure we need oil you know and we need it desperately
but the other countries that you know that have oil but not as big you know like they say you know like when the prices went up and then they went down when they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in or something
well the it it's an advantage you know it's like you're saying okay i can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon
people take advantage take advantage of that you know like the the companies were saying we're trying not to raise our prices but when you know when we get a barrel coming in at more than what we're selling it for we've got to raise our prices
you you know you you got to pay forty dollars at least and you know for uh for one gallon and it's it was selling like at twenty five or something
and uh everything i mean and and the expenses you know of the war you know it's like uh you know it's like who's gaining on this okay because uh i uh does does the government own any gas companies like like you know like gas stations and stuff
i don't know if the government owns i'm not sure about that
and so they got they got the meat place and so you just go there and you can't find chicken there you got to go to another place to find the chicken
but the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then i have to moderate that because it's like i can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars uh you know three times a week
well the thing is is that um i basically i basically know how much i have right
i i can tell like uh i get all my money out of the teller
well that's they want they want me to call down there every so often i mean i told my dad listen dad listen if you want to save money i won't call so often you know he goes we want to keep in touch so it doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you
like my uh for for you know my roommate goes what do you want and i said i want a backpack
yeah yeah because it's like you know say you know it's like we're saying let's go eat out before spring break i go let's not go eat out before spring break let's see how much money we have afterwards
and so he's getting that and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that that's why you want to join
and then they come in last and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it
and so it's like the same thing with you know so they have this think tank and they got to come up with ideas but see uh the the thing is that is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff
they they have like this different policy i don't know my dad works for them but it's like like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know it's like
says let's throw it away will say we'll buy it from you
well like they say like nobody can get enough you know it's like
well i think have have you ever read the book nineteen eighty four
you know it's like you're not going to go in there and say no listen there's a separate country why because you're going into the border
you know but i think i think the thing is is that
there the thing like they were saying they go you know like could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button
my my point of view to that is is that it would have had so much i mean the attack would have been so complete on if they had i mean the first you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used
and uh you know there's there's just
you know like people will go like they like the goes and goes into and what see i don't believe in war that's my thing i don't believe that anybody should die
you know and so then you know you have because what happens is suppose i'm i go to war and i'm holding a gun and i'm just looking at myself holding a gun and whoever shoots first survives you know
no i i don't think so i think uh and they're getting they're especially getting their life back together now because a lot of things that you saw on a lot of uh inhabitants of
what happens is as that you're uh you know as you go from the country to a city crime always increases right because in the country people still respect uh the property of other people
that's uh that's uh the main reason i think uh everywhere because uh you have deaths i mean i mean you have murders and you have you know people stealing other people's stuff and that's a lot of it has to do with drugs
right and like let's say you're you you go you know you're driving out and you're driving back home and it's late at night and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints
yeah there's a there's a a song that i know which says you know that it's like in uh nineteen eighty eight nineteen eighty nine the local state and federal governments spent
you know and he goes yeah i just came up here to work and i go oh you did i bet you make uh very good money up here he goes yeah i make a lot a lot of money he goes you know and uh in the movie
okay in one part the guy goes out of jail and within uh two months he had all his house payments done everything paid and you know and he had enough money to you know it's like
and and to me you know it's like now i'm twenty two but i still feel you know it's like yeah we never threw a football or something and the way i was brought up and he wants me now he like he you know like he wants to be best friends now and it's very
you know i love you and let's go out and do things together when i don't feel like it you know
you know and uh i was brought up the same way if if it doesn't matter what age you have if just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up you know but his what he does is when he gets home he separates his his work from his house
yeah yeah but uh it's just it's just something that you know my theory is you know when when you have kids and all you want to do well what i'll do is you know it like
i mean you might have a problems but it's not your kids problems you know and you got to try to to be with them as much as you can and to you know like thing is is that you know like if
but you know like four i mean four four children is expensive especially when you consider like especially for for me which i'm paying out of state tuition i'm paying you know three thousand no what is it two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester
yeah well for example i used to like the old an old and and then what happened was that said hey i can make money a lot of money doing this
so it's like nothing happened during the seventies everything happened during the sixties the seventies i don't know what they're called you know it's like
yeah i know can you imagine the uh like a big picture of and what is it him just standing there you know
rehabilitate or you know restore anybody i think it'll only make them worse but i i believe that can come in and change a person's heart
yeah i have a degree in social work you see it you know the ones that have a genuine character change it is obvious and they know that they're they're not going to pardon someone from the governor
you know what i'm saying they're not going to go without going through every channel of authority in the prison so i feel like you know that's is there is occasions where there are they do spare lives and you know i leave that with the governor who
but of the system but i know what you're saying uh but also they're under a law because we haven't been removed from the law we've just been taken out from under under a law because under the law if your child mocked back talked you he would be stoned
but in the new he's looking at your heart and so i guess that's what what i mean by their character changes and you know what i mean it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart what's the character showing me here and
you can't force people but i think people are hurting and they're out doing crack sitting on the street they were the kind of people that i think mostly we would want to receive it if it was presented to see i don't know i guess i'm kind of frustrated that
if you know about i think is his name see i even know his name because he's on the news a lot and i never hardly watch the news not you know not like some people hour and a half a day or anything
i know and he pulled that out that is so funny i heard it on the radio i heard the audio portion on the radio in the car but i didn't see it but
this is at a tip i bet these are really good seats and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor and you know we i mean we just they called us at five and the game started at seven so we just threw everything together ran over and got the tickets and
you know but we got to sit by first base if they'd hit a ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in you know
you know what i mean how to train them so they're going to be a blessing and so you know they do that and they they just live lean pretty much they don't she doesn't shop at you know and stuff like that
but a lot women in shop at so it's like a kind of store it's pretty nice and everything's pretty expensive and you know you just can't do that and you don't go to baseball games as much or you get pictures like we did you know what i mean
so i don't know do you enjoy doing it
i know you too i hope you have a nice day and we'll talk to you later bye
you know intellectually doesn't it's not as sound intellectually but like you said i mean come on i had six years of college and i don't know the metric system and i don't care to learn it and i'm not some kind of an idiot i just
yeah i think it failed too because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous i think have so much stress on them right now
i mean if you look at the average family it's like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this and it's like i mean come on let's take the pressure off
you too i think that was good that was the best one usually i get distracted off the topic you know what i mean
um yeah sure um i think i think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back
because i always think the mail never comes on these days and you're like well what is it
that overall though i just think we're just going to i don't know see i know i guess i'm kind of leery of this topic because
and so um i guess because i guess i feel like i know what their long-term vision is i'm kind of like
it be do you understand it's i guess it's a principle of giving and receiving you give it no strings attached and they may never give you anything back but
you know what i'm saying i think we're loaning money to too many nations
but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them
yeah i know what you're saying
because i guess i guess i feel like um if they're on a diet like that i'm gonna you know honor that
you know when we're having guests we just kind of feel like just do it and i made blueberry cobbler and we had extra crust with it i mean it was so fattening but i don't think we gained any weight from it so
but i did bake apples so that it would be not brownies you know i figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies
you know uh and we have a nine and a half year old son and it's because you know we were eighteen when we had him so we're we're kind of looking at this from the other aspect of
and i have another friend from uh that she was born there she's i guess i do know a little bit i went to one time
but um they're all though really protected them see that broke out a revival in that news and never told you about there's been a real revival in since that earthquake because there's a lot of
i don't think there are the little box is black on the top of the pyramid of the sun it's black so yeah you can't really tell but it is kind of weird you know you think wow there is where they did human sacrifices to false and
i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to you know just leave their freedoms there
in a way in a sense i'm a pacifist but i'm really not you know what i'm saying
you know how can you know the says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you and it's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind so it's like how can you
but then again though the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what i'm saying like so he didn't just say don't kill your don't kill your enemies but don't only don't kill them bless them you know
would be to bless them and humbly go to their other king or the other ruler and say what have we done to offend you
because it wouldn't make any sense you know what i'm saying it'd look absolutely ridiculously stupid but it would work out because
this is where everyone always says my husband always goes through that i go yeah for one if someone broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith to to to take authority over that
and i know people that have done that i mean i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes
but and i have a neighbor with a big motorbike and he likes to run down the street with it and you you can probably hear him but um i don't know so do you enjoy reading anything like that um
i know that you know the further we go from the worse the food is for you but still somehow makes us all
i don't know i like to i like to my i like to be able to eat really healthy you know what am saying and i guess i'm going to have to wait for the millennium i think though because i do don't think we're going to restore the earth to you know i think is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be
but uh in the meantime we pray over our food because i'm always looking down my plate and i think man isn't this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment but
i mean think to think that is almost it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the you know what i'm saying it's to big than us and i think in charge and going to restore it when he wants to so sometimes i get bogged down in the
you know in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking but you know there's a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that and then i just chunk off like water off your back some of it and
and um i've all my relatives my mom you know you probably read or something i don't know we read a lot i know people have read all those books but
really yeah see i didn't i don't i thought my uh i thought i live in and i thought it was pretty normal but anyway but i guess you're right though it has been real hot because
yeah i know it's been bothering me a lot but yeah i think normally i think the weather overall has been um probably like you said probably a little bit warm and so
they again i don't know really what steps there are that they
uh-huh yeah i don't know how you combat that i i don't know where you start or with a lot of these kids um
and i don't know how you combat that i really i don't know what the answer is to that problem you know i don't
yeah we were just resigned you know resigned to well the only way we were going to fix this one is that you know if you plow it all under and put everything back on top of it again
especially in um the area you know there's there's so much money and everyone can afford they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn and
and the time that it took especially when you start mowing and then when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water
but one of the things i do remember was when it talked about uh the grass and there there being the shade tolerant types of grass and i think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used
uh-huh it does and the um the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region but um but we like it so it's a nice change so we'll be here a couple of years and we thought well we'll take advantage of it and and see what all the coast is like
okay well i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in and uh
we've been wanting to well not me but uh it's been recommended or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here i'm like no you know you know for what's cut down here you know more will be cut down someplace else and
so uh yeah i knew i think there's lots that be that could be done to to improve how things are done now
right well that's a great idea i wish we were that uh involved in uh or that our city was so involved in that involved in recycling
and uh it's so you know he we have all our piles of of recyclables also
right and i've seen where some places have taken a plastic and uh
i believe we are i do believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening
oh no i understand we have uh we've gone through the same thing with ours we've cut you know they've been ill i mean i take off work to take care of my cats you know the my boss thinks i'm absolutely crazy
oh my husband just died it was like we can't take it back you've got we've got to keep it now
oh yeah oh the whole time i was pregnant they kept saying are you getting rid of your cats are you getting rid of your cats you can't be pregnant and have cats i'm like uh no no no right the child will learn to like cats and deal with them i'm sorry we are not getting rid of the cats
you know we get this lackadaisical attitude and say huh you know why should we vote
you know if we get someone in there like that then you know they could make all sorts of changes if they were you know had enough pull
they'll strike a chord in something you know in some of the people that so will say well you know this guy's got everything together you know i like what he says you know it'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him
i i know i have uh i'll stick to uh to uh you know sometimes i'll stick to a certain party depends on the guy
i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party and um
right or what you've heard on which i think is just outrageous i i don't agree with how the uh media handles elections
i you know i'm i'm tired of hearing about the polls you know you know this is how he stands such and such a day
you know i i agree with the freedom of of the press and that's you know all the amendments but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things
just hasn't used that much so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing and i'm the administrator for our local area network and i need to keep that going and
i don't know if my boss will spring for it
mine sort of he looks at the pattern and he says how do you get that from there to the to the material
which isn't you know pretty much what we look look for anyway
and sometimes i think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines and that they'll run a topic into the ground
right but i understand why you know doesn't want to go in and and uh take sides i mean because that would definitely look like another
and he said um let's give her some race horse shots
to me oh i noticed those dogs dogs are so well trained anytime they hear your voice they come so that made me very proud
so but i have a hard time getting anybody because i guess do you work
so um during the day i mean i think and i understand also they want men
you know make them do during the day but nobody's home
oh thank you and i hope you enjoy and get through that birthday party
so i know of what you're talking about as far as the market was concerned and i'll tell you uh we we had kind of a charming house it was a cedar shake house and very weathered and
and so i thought well shoot i'm going to
and and probably you know i think that they could if they have problems with uh sand bugs of some kind i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a
well i think she i think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are and
oh i think so i have a little spinach
and they don't ever plan it like as like you do i think if you can count on it every four years then
if they don't you know they'll say oh we're planning to go so and so that go to to a certain place that weekend with somebody else and we're already locked in
i don't know where i used to live in
and i i don't know we we feel like that that we can make it on one income it it may be tough but we may have to give up some
on me but they didn't call that a drug test so that i think they checked for drugs they just don't tell you they did
so i guess if they perfect that and then it's not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that
are enjoyable that you don't have to you know strain yourself or sweat
i guess on the days they do trash or something like that apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably favorably because they're going to do it i don't know how how soon they're going to do it or
on the radio station i think it's they were talking about the i think it's in they're using oh recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs
i guess occasionally i'll hear someone at work say something though
i would think they could find a better way to fund it though but they haven't for
um well i'm a i'm a counselor a therapist by trade so most of my books are um i guess what you'd call self-improvement type of books
good self help well um probably the best one that i i know of and i work with all the time is called for
yeah i was just i was just thinking at at they they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks
just to help us deal with with all the things that we have to deal with so i keep getting stacks of books i need to read and i don't know when i'm going to get to them all
well i like that kind of stuff i think the last novel i read i read in i guess conjunction with my wife over vacation last year it was a um
i don't know don't know when i'm going to get a chance to do that but
i'll be one morning and you know the first thing you do is you get up and you you you you you you you feed this cat something something and and you make sure that it can get to its litterbox well
uh the interesting thing is is that uh the amount of money you can can run up on them i don't know do you know any people that run up big big bills
the interesting thing about it is is that from a uh uh an economy standpoint or in economics i i thinks it's i think it's poor poor uh economics to to carry all that consumer debt
uh but i mean what do you say it's like shucks boss i'm sure sorry you've got all that debt well he's had had two kids in college and and this kind of thing and that
you know what i think's remarkable is uh it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have have have really breakthrough years
and and the question is how do you forecast that if you had to you know if you had to bet on who would be in the i mean it'd be really tough
well is there enough money that's part of it i oh oh that was part of argument i don't know if you read but a a a local commentary and
well and that i think that's maybe part of it that that the um and it you know if i owned the team i think you'd like them to do well but the question of losing big big money that what didn't didn't did actually make money on the
and uh you know i mean i i guess as we get older if you're probably going if if you if you compare to go to a a sport a a say you go to a rock concert or or even a performance uh
uh or or i think if we see it you know we see hollering injustice i think that's wrong now the question is is was there injustice in or was there injustice in and
and and do these kind of things i think culturally it really destroyed a lot of the people that that went over and saw these people you just couldn't believe that they would
and that that you know and you i think that's one of those things when we get to we're going to ask
and we the problem is they call up and make this deal you know and well we're taking that and and we also hit the
i guess it's it comes out sporadically like twice a week or something but i think what's interesting is that if you're that there uh this
and that but and and you know people accuse them of controlling the news he says you know we don't control the news we just report it the way we the way it is and
they've been some people move around and uh is anyway the i don't know do you do you do you seem to can you tell much difference between the local radio stations
i think that adds to the diversity i think that uh i like that uh there i know you know i don't know if you kept up but he's been protesting that
and i think if we remember that that they're out after the ratings
oh i like it i i i have a foreign actually i have more than one foreign automobile and i i i find the uh i find the the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters i was trying to build a shed
i think it's interesting you went you know when you you go out there and you're looking for a wrench and you want the next size larger i've got i inherited some some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds
yeah and and you've got to go over there and try it and i suppose you know i need a larger one i need a smaller one i mean obviously you can look at it and say well
it's like a mill you know we we do uh um well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill conductive bond wire on on semiconductor devices
oh i think i don't think so i i think that that uh i think they've now just taken the attitude that well if it happens if it because it there a lot of things that that uh um like sports you know it's a hundred meter
yeah and and so um but but when you go to order a drink um you know well you say they they i don't know it's uh
i don't know i i think that i i think i think the government is going to more or less leave it alone i think they've got i think there are more pressing problems
well the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic i don't know if you read any of the history on where the but there was an option to build it across
it it's it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting and and and
to uh where he's got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest to him
yes but the but the question is you know if somebody offered you you know a thousand dollars a day to to grow something in your backyard would you do it
when the uh religious organizations you know the church has been accused of a lot of things in reality i think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people
that's that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that i thought no it's really funny but i thought it it turns you think back and yeah it was him but with a
uh it was it was it was interesting but uh i'm just curious what he has to say now that they've got them all lit
uh we probably could do something about it now and if there isn't if there isn't and we do some the right things i think how do you feel about about all this smog and mess stuff on cars
and and they don't think it well i guess they do think something of it but
they had one with spots on it and something i didn't go but it was it was showing they i mean uh
well the you know the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that it cost that it took to contest the the football um issue
i think maybe there's too much responsibility put on the teachers to motivate these kids i had a a friend that was administrator in and said if the parents read books
but that a lot of the schools i would think the kids you're talking to question of of how much reading do those kids' parents do
that's one of those really tough situations i think the kids need some time to play
nevertheless good if if people like if more people like you though that understand the problem get in and
we moved oh last and we're getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we decided we went to i've forgotten one of the paint stores and they just said oh you can get by and i forgotten what it was you put down
you know you want this you want this to look like this and you want that to look like that and of course if it's all white you're all right but when you start getting into colors have you had problems getting colors to match
and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't uh the mold everything is white in a new house everything is white
oh good luck we wound up selling the house actually i i don't know whether it made actually it does it's interesting that the white um
makes the rooms look bigger one of the in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding uh like picture frames i don't know what you call that that actually that are along the walls that you know up a couple of feet
well the one i think is interesting is the police chief who says he wants to and did you hear yesterday that said that uh he should
think it i think what's interesting is that uh uh the political activists and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating
and you know the it seems to me that what happened in the in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly the the uh i think it's don't vote because they don't think
i don't know you can you can disagree with and uh what's what's the lady's name
yeah and i but i think even i even those people are it's like and and these people i think it's i find it interesting that everybody's so busy politicking that
i i have got to run to a meeting it's good talking to you i don't think we've gone our our ten minutes but i think we've we've talked long enough so
i think there's a there's a real challenge there there's also this this issue of of uh
yeah i think the church has sends out missionaries that
well yeah or say say the volunteer say that say that it was mandatory
okay thank you you do the same bye-bye
yeah i know what you mean um i in they they do have capital punishment
of course you know they're they're playing it up real big that it was uh looked like it was a very very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy
um you know he would come home and and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to decide you know after
and uh yeah everybody everybody was pretty much you know let's burn him
but i mean there's there's there's a lot of other crimes out there i mean besides murder i think uh now if you're dealing drugs now caught more than twice or something
and of course uh isn't a very big woman i mean she's you know she appeared to me to be very petite and um she took a horse shoe and and turned it turned it into an
and the problem is that ideally you they you know the world would like you to be completely indifferent so um but i i understand what you say about the environmental movement um
i mean you know if you had long hair in high school in the sixties you got labeled a hippie and you keep that image your whole life no matter what you do and i just
and uh you know if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then i'll be around a lot longer
uh you can pretty much uh figure what they're going to be and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you
and uh of course nothing ever goes down i mean uh i remember you know i have five children total i have three left in the house
which has less crime and uh less you know less highways and so it's a cheaper place to live as far as the insurance company's concerned so my my i think my insurance dropped about uh sixty dollars a year
yeah believe me i know there is i lived in and i don't know if you're familiar with but maybe five percent of the people in actually were from
uh they've been putting a lot of uh stress on it and of course speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to you know do everything they're supposed to do and of course they've uh been cutting the teachers salaries because they say we don't have the money to do it and
some students do horrible until like eighth grade some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade and then all of a sudden everything clicks in you know and then there are some students that you know read well at five years old
and it it it everything started to click in for him and he knew what he needed to do um and this year it it happened for uh for the daughter
really doing great this year and she has the right attitude towards school and everything and i think it's just a matter of everybody has to find their own path i remember when i was in school i did horrible
yeah it is um my children had a uh real culture shock um when we lived in i guess i don't know if you've heard about the school district but they're uh they really stress academics there
and it was just a complete culture shock because i mean they they're riding on the bus in the morning with uh other kids that you know are a sleep because they got up at three o'clock and were doing chores and you know it's
uh actually i'm sorry not until yeah i guess it was around eighty two eighty three i found out i had a grandmother
and i think it and i think it's causing us a lot of trouble and and a lot of problems
i mean uh you should have no objection to it it's like uh going down to get your license and checking your eyes i mean you know why do i need my eyes checked well we want to make sure you can see
luckily i've always been in the engineering sector and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as uh you know hurting someone i mean it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it
and i think if if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say well if you impose uh
but the thing was that i could do the job myself i mean the parts cost me
yeah i uh i don't mind it um there was a time when i had my i mean of course i loved it um
and i have the same problem i mean you can tell him from me but it doesn't matter i mean i've i've had greasy fingernails for years and it still takes me twice as long as i think it's going to take to do the job
and so it and if i have something that's really major that i can't handle or feel i don't have the time to handle i'll take it to him to do it
and i guess there are some people out there like that um you know i always thought maybe you know if he took more of an interest and you know what i was doing and maybe we could have communicated better
you know it just you know i saw the family falling apart down there
yeah and so i think it's kind of important that i that i you know nurture the relationship i have with my children now and i'm doing my best to keep that up
yeah i uh started back to school in fact i was going to school while i was working fifty one hours a week and that's why i you know if you're working if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty one hours a week there's not much time left to spend with
well they i think when they open the show up they give you two different views of one from the east and one from the west
and uh when i came down to it was uh you know i found myself rooting for the home team
and uh you know she just doesn't like them and um she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie and i've told her you know everybody i know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick
and then there's there's others that uh uh i i wish i had time to see it's like i enjoy watching it's very funny some of the things in it are mindless but i i just don't have time to watch it
and uh i think that would that would serve us well plus it's got uh good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along going to the store
yeah i think that's getting to be kind of important now that uh you know the price is becoming
you know what i mean it i don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the
yeah i remember when that happened so unless they're really changing the model
um i remember when the movement first came about and i thought it was a very good idea at the time i was one of those uh children if you know what i mean and uh
and uh you know it's there's there's a heck of a lot of difference between you know the intake that you get from and and movies and what you hear in school and then what reality is
uh i remember uh i've i've worked since i was well i started delivering papers when i was ten and i had a real job when i was thirteen so i've you know worked most of my life but i remember when i got out of high school
and and that is unreal because we've got people out here that are just poverty level but then we got these million dollar homes so you know where do you find a happy medium and how does your salary deal with that it's not it's just not doing it
well very well um it's slow though i think at least they're making the effort to put it out there and make it available and and
i think they're really trying it's going to take years though i mean it's just it's that mindset
it's okay i think your record should stand for itself that
you know every time say if you change jobs that you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place
it does i very seldom if any i can't remember you know a day that i walked out and the wind wasn't blowing
you know getting people involved so that that's really strange i i was wondering why we had somebody from though i was thinking do we have a in or
so i've been two nights in a row and i i'm going to take it pretty seriously i'm going to start going every night just you know even if i like tonight i only went for thirty minutes but i at least did something
the ones we have now the kids would sneak off and we were just being kids and we found what we thought was just an old water hole so we was going swimming
yeah well they there was uh i am sorry there was uh i remember now there was like uh a baby pool just about a foot deep
yes i remember my little brother riding a bicycle through it we were all kids anyway
in i'm serious if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain i i swear they close everything down i just laugh i mean i do they get i mean and traffic slows down to nothing
oh well this is pretty wooded area down here so in in a lot of parts yeah i know is supposed to be flat but they've got you know down by the there's a lot of uh
yeah well down by there's a bunch of wooded area this but beautiful they've got trees and trees are supposed to you know purify you know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff it's a philodendron
i don't know what they are called i have always called them well i don't know what i have called them but when i come down here everybody told me they are flags
i am looking for a pen i want to write this down because well that is where i went this year because i waited too late to really plant stuff but i did not know that these hyacinths like i said i do not know anything about plants i did not know the hyacinths hyacinths were going to die
make it more oh easier to find out you know what's going on do you know what i mean
that's what i mean if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and
i don't know like you know in school they didn't teach you about uh the government not really
well i'm not sure they're yeah i know how they do it it like it with the abortion issues and stuff
oh i know if enough people think like that it you know would make a difference if people stopped thinking like that
i don't know if i did understand politics i probably would vote more but like i said if i voted for or like when uh
which i guess if you got turmoil in your personal life you're going to let it come into work but
do you know what i mean
yeah they do have like those parental control things on the uh remote controls you know where you can block out what channels you do not want them to watch
and i told my husband he cursed my kids they were both born with pointy ears
show i have seen where every time they sit down at the table they pray before they eat and i thought that was real neat
i remember him in school but i do not it is just this little dot with arms and feet and little eyes and his parents are there they have it like before one of the church things uh you know church that comes on
and it is a just this little dot and he will go out and get himself into trouble and come home and the parents will tell him that there is a verse in the that will help him with that and it is just
oh oh well we think our neighbors are stealing from us actually my husband
well the only things that we can do as citizens is you know like those uh watch groups that they'll have walking but they can be dangerous too and i've thought about it you know uh
you know forty well uh i don't think y'all have the same channels but here in we only get two channels and that's um
i think and that comes on different channel
it really is and that's a tear jerker it gets you i mean it makes you feel really sorry for her but it's hilarious too especially with that uh little guy in it oh he looks like a little
don't know either he's got curly blonde hair he just a little freckly little
i know well the only reason i know why it ended is on one night
no and he could climb out the window well and we our whole house has you know every room leads to
all i know is all's i can really remember is him flying this great big dog this great big huge
well i heard a friend of mine told me she got last night and she said that was hilarious that
we had saw some termites and we thought about getting it sprayed i think it was like
oh no he didn't know what he was doing he really should have hired people
well he's got seven layers of shingles up there and he told us it was a completely new roof like i said he didn't know what he was doing
uh oh ancient discoveries you know the how they found out like that uh ancient man performed performed uh
yeah i know i heard say that you know we're either
she was about eighty and she looked so good i mean she was standing just as straight and tall and she had a small waist and she didn't have you know like you know how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle
steroids yeah i couldn't think i was going i was trying to say hemorrhoids no i was trying to say hormones yeah hormones but yeah uh steroids but i stay away from that crap
yeah oh i when i did ride my friends bike that one time i had uh i don't know what i was trying to do i was trying to make a turn and i never could make a turn in a bike i can do it in my car
but i tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked and i told her a dog was chasing me but i wrecked it into the curb i didn't hurt it too bad i scratched it on the the
much you know what i mean
yeah they are well i thought about that i thought well now men you know have to fight to be equal
and i think that's only right though really he one guy said the judge looked at him and said so he says heifer
and he said well he said fat he said cattle
um-hum well i know the family is really going through changes but now we're trying to go back to about the sixties when the parents you know when the mother was staying at home
well i think for i think one that would be uh
kids could see their parents you know how hard they work
i do not have much to compare it to to me our causes don't seem as important as you all's were do you know what i mean
so i just hope if i ever go to court that they all
no i don't think they can you know i saw it on too
well you're allowed to show their character do you know what i mean and if it shows that their character's you know
tell you what we need to do is go into law and then we'll be able to or vote do you vote yeah do you vote
they won't say yes and they won't say no to just certain issues just because they don't know what the public wants or the public's split on it
oh see that's what i mean then they let them out and then they're able to do it again
i don't know i think it's i think it only has about five or six more years to go because it's a it's a really old bush and
just uh you know for them i mean they they're going to have to start gardening it's going to be from the ground up
and they said well we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just getting this property developed
like after it's been raining for a few months they say the roots have developed so that's all they work on just a leafy they don't do anything
but then the weather's like man i mean it's it get's pretty mundane i mean you can only talk about about the situation you know just so long
um something that i i think that i've noticed that i i have a friend i think if you're going into like uh law or medicine
yeah it's it's actually turning out to be more more useful than what i thought and um i also have a good languages background linguistics
yeah i i i i i think i think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school i mean they they find out whether just how much of a people person they are
oh and i tell you what i worked at as well and i i can tell you one thing there are just some people that i you know you just came to the point where
i mean and oh i eventually worked in a lab in a lab as a lab technician and i worked front desk and i mean somebody could walk in the door and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say
and um that was pretty heartrending for her i think when she finally came to the realization that you know no i cannot i cannot take care of myself
and they i know they and well they had well they had they had seen it coming so so i mean it i mean i i i i hardly i i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me
were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible i i think i think i think you know for myself i i see that as probably the the
yeah but uh i'm i i think that you know i mean we always uh i mean i've i've had a a lot of good experiences with uh with many many people
i don't have that i don't have that uh experience to share uh i i i do i do listen to a lot of you know i do i switch the stations stations a lot because i don't have a cassette player in my car um
and um you you listen a lot if you listen if you listen hear a lot of old gospel um uh especially well the black gospel you know you will you know you can really pick it up i mean it you
they they do copy versions they do cover versions of of you know like standards i guess you could call it yeah so i think it's kind of absurd you know the fact that you know they don't really they don't really
yeah i don't know it may've it may've been somebody else because i think i think that even did a i think that was a cover i you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of
yeah and then the cover version i think i mean i thought was absolutely it was pitiful
the uh the and you know i mean a lot of people they go you know they're better than the and i'm like you know you you don't know what you're talking about
yeah you just sort of you know well i guess i can just humor them you know at this point but
um i don't know music is kind of in a weird it it it's in a very weird position right now i think that i mean i like you know things like to hear you know like what they call world music
uh you know i think i think that you know using a i guess what they call it is eclectic you know using drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a a synthesis of a new type of music um
let's say another audience let's say a and then when they hear it it it it's a really it's another form of music and you know it's sort of um trying to draw out the best sources the the best of every type of music
because i mean there are some i mean i like there are some you know types of heavy metal that i really like but but i wouldn't i wouldn't say that i i completely like heavy metal i i think you know it and it's the same way with world you know world music takes
i think their biggest problem is just you know obtaining food to live so when you have the basic needs uh being unmet i don't think you think globally as far as you know
that there'll be some you know politically speaking you know he's going to have more power and i think it's a step in the right direction i think realizes that he's got a a major uh
the new uh glasnost um i think it's kind of uh escalate to a point where it's out of control and i think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how in order to keep the peace on peace on both sides
so i think that's where you know kind of where he's stuck you know what i'm saying
i think it's i think it's a lot of uh
yeah big time major but you know that's that's what happens when you know the cork blows and you can't handle it anymore i mean that's
you know when you've lost something or or uh uh don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize you know
what's out there and what you know what you have and what you don't have
computer here at the house and i made a spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month
and so that that has worked out pretty good and then i used to work for and i have when i retired from there or left i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an and we had an out
choice the choices you have in nursing homes now whereas used to you used to have only you put you know when when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves and there was no other choice you couldn't take them in your own home then they went into a nursing home you know maybe you lived
you know like where they prepare their meals for them and and they still live somewhat independently but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals and then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level which is full care
and i guess that that it was a pilot program i think where she lived so it's probably not widely available
say like you're saying with and
and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know if you had if you were a teacher then you know that was it
in that other you know uh that i should do it or that or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help
they just you know just kind of scoot it on another spot on the on the sink and and put the next plate down and and in a while get around to it and i think most women walk in and and
and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be done this is the time this needs to be done but
this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know you both got to they were both working at whatever things were
cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to
i know i you read about it in the paper every day somebody who's done this or that
and the the laws are all the rules some of the things that would make sense to to tell the jury that this this guy has a a prior criminal history you know where he's raped ten women
and so they say well this is you know i don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal
i guess so we tend to use just bait and a few lures but bait tends to work the best just some blood bait
he's at a dangerous point right now he understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in
and you get you can get a system that can take any design you want and you can push a button and it'll convert every
it may be arrogant but i mean let them come to us
yeah and and instead of having the world speak we found out that we can translate and that's what i think we ought to do with the metric system
i i guess i believe i i think the has gone overboard the wrong way you know they're sitting there on number ten saying they're saying absolutely no gun control we don't even want to think about it and
it's not a big deal for them to go if they can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket you know i mean they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of psychiatric record armed you know felony record you know
you know i i that's that's the kind of people i like i say i don't think the guy who's going to rob a is going to rob a whether he has a gun or a knife baseball bat or you know whatever
and it and it's basic stuff it's like it's don't you know when you're climbing over a barbed wire fence don't point you don't lean your gun against it you know and you and then you crawl over it and have it shoot yourself and uh it
and i was like uh you know we're in a nice neighborhood but still and you and then i've got it so far sometimes i think i i wonder if i
you know i assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there and it's in a case and it's you know it's put up and it's away and all that but i don't want to take the chance and i think if somebody ever does break in it's going to take me a year to find the shells and then get it don't come in the
it was like you you come after me you're going to get it you know and now there's so many other things where are the kids what are they doing you know where is this person coming in from uh you've got and and if if you if you manage to get it out
yeah it's it's i kind of think we we have two big dogs in the backyard i always kind of thought that too kind of an extra buffer
so that's the hardest thing for us and um we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home we have a three year old and a two year old and i'm trying to stay home as long as i can
yeah because i know you know i i really get pressure from because i have a career also and i get a lot of pressure from people that you know my colleagues that why am i staying home
you know whereas before that never would have happened people would have said why are you going to work
you know i think there's so much prejudice still there and it's kind of more covert now people used to be more clear and say you know well i believe in this or i believe in that and now
you know i think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice but people think oh we're in the nineties we're beyond all that you know
that is part of the change i think that i've seen probably you know in the past twenty years or whatever is now
people have you know think they're kids have to have five hundred dollars worth of toys
yeah yeah yeah that sounds like a good idea my only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government i don't know do we wind up with more red tape and more problems so yeah yeah
oh it's just unbelievable how much you go through when i just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar scan and i mean a chiropractor got it in one time it was just strange
i think it would be a great idea i'm not sure about requiring it you know of people because people are going you know feeling resentful i don't know but i think it would be a great idea
seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of you know what they want to be or do or you know they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time and we sure our country all countries sure need help so
but i don't know if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to
you actually got paid too while in the it wasn't much but i guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses were covered
yeah i've heard that like in and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered them you know on the you know street so yeah
might not go if it was voluntary but i don't know how they'd enforce it if it was
she started some type of um national um organization for youth to volunteer like to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards
minority you know um i think it was in a area they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers instead of they said every all these gangs kids could join to belong
but they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know so they were trying to start that out so if there's people out there that are
yeah all those old good ones that you you know wish they had on more now but
let's see what are some other ones i've seen lately i'm trying to remember i can't oh i just saw one on the video oh um have you seen
they remodeled the entire back yard then they sold the house and got divorced so i don't know what that says about it all
and moved to and bought a house immediately you know which of course is now devalued with the housing market so i don't know if we we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least we've got a place to live
uh i don't know we've we've tried different times we've done like a survey of like taking you know the past three months of where all the money went
that's what my husband said so this last year he changed it then of course we didn't get hardly i mean nearly as much back and it was like oh no we better find another way of saving money
and so i keep hearing the forecast it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain but it really hasn't rained yeah
yeah well my three and half year old he really wants to have the pool out in the backyard you know so any day i mean all long he's been wanting a pool in the backyard so i'm hoping you know that
what i hate is i hate having to water so much around here you know well we never used to have to water our lawns you know in it was always enough rain here and there
i can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that i just don't even want to go out you know the house to get the mail even leave me in the air conditioning
yeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months
well if i i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really
you know if used wrongly so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway i don't know if it prevents it but seems like the jury system does have it's advantages
and i don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers at that point they're really getting a select group it's not just random people
there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more and it's really hard to control you can't control eleven three year olds with one person you know yeah you know
you know you really can't know everything about what's going to happen i felt safe that
at least they think it's fun it's not a big you know trauma to them to learn something yeah
yeah i need to even just for a couple days a mornings a week or something to have something like that so i think i'm going to look for that remind me of that now that you mention it i was been meaning to do that you know
yeah and i think that you know if they can get enough going
they'll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city but it's not i think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this and it's not going to be i don't think
yeah i do to because it's amazing how much you know trash we can generate i know this year we took our tree they had a place in the park where you could go have your tree shredded and they gave you a little
yeah i don't know what else they could recycle more of i guess we don't really use that many tin cans i guess there's some places where you can recycle aluminum but i don't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff in i don't know if those are recyclable or
what can we do about crime i don't know the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people and they keep letting out people that have you know these horrible records
yeah well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous i mean you hear about people you know six and seven times have committed burglaries and they're still you know only serving six months in prison
yeah and one things that they're saying now are you going are you a student or are you in the work force or
that's it's awful so one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it i know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing but
i'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing you know for people to report it so that's probably something else they could do
i don't know it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs you know and that's like as long as it it almost makes me feel in a way like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have you know because these kids are saying why should i go
got to do with crime you know you hear about people selling their babies you know to get some crack i mean just oh gosh horrible stuff like that one of the things they're doing is is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack
oh i know and i just go to the library because i just they're expensive i mean it and they go through them so fast you know
if you can rent a steamer if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble it's really old you don't know what it's put on with
and then if that if you discover the little tricks and tips about you know how you get through corners and how you do trim and uh
and i've i was told i always used the nice wide masking tape but i've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth because it
well i wish you very good luck with it and i will tell you that i have retired from the painting business the last time i had something done was my kitchen cabinets and i decided that was too much to tackle i'd hire a professional
well i hope your project turns out great and i really uh think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting i think that could give it a really
well i think it was uh thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft and people said well they uh young people who were drafted have to
and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization but on the other hand i'm not sure what the permanent value of it was i don't know what we got for all the money
uh and lots of uh out of the way places but i don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better
tell me what books you read
so i'm uh i was just thinking when they told me the topic i should just i should read the uh titles of the five books that are sitting on my desk right now that i'm in the middle of
i read the uh which lists all the upcoming books forthcoming books and uh
well i think it uh they need you in different ways
so that then students could watch that and uh criticize the methods used and and analyze it figure out what worked and what didn't work
and i hope maybe we're going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with uh
and i knew the people involved both the people who perjured and the people who uh were defendants
and it seems to me that you'd get a lot more uh information if your questions were heard if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things or if or the lawyers things or even the judge
and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year and then uh you're supposed to keep it recycled every day
and we had to write code in binary and uh have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which i don't think exist anymore you never see one of those punch cards anymore
kind of bulky and all they did was just uh make a beep noise and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call
i don't know uh i mean i think cars are great course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff and they're easy some some of them are easy to work on a being a four cylinder is very easy to work on uh excellent warranty i mean just unbelievable warranty
we just got with him and told him what all we wanted and he's charging about a buck a square foot to design it and he's registered certified and registered so at least we know we're it's not gonna fall in or something if it's built but uh i have heard
and so what what you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in uh high-tech scrubber systems
as you know the they're allowed to come on site the anytime they want drive through and see and inspect so it's a full time uh everybody has your home phone number type of job uh
expenditures because it can get very expensive but i think we you know we do all kinds of things to make the the the world a better place to live and i think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that i really would
it's easier to find painters but you have to be you have to be aware of what of how messy they can get and are they gonna put on a good a good two coats and are they gonna caulk exterior
or i guess the financial planners the training now we've had it for about four years who got our businesses and and and our life in line how to manage credit cards how to put away say for you know money markets and this kind of thing
i mean uh uh the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood and my wife didn't know and i stopped payment on the check and he'd already been paid by a cashing firm and and they're suing us they're suing me on this and it's for a hundred and thirty four dollars
oh all righty i think we know what we're going to speak about um tell you what i'll start off how's that
um but i think if we quit uh building these with the color
life in prison then he's available for parole if it's if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole so what you know let's quit with the system
um kind of gets back to the second request we've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an verdict the a situation like that i'd say no let's just go like a regular vote eight to four tells me that there were eight
yeah yeah i get back to comment when he uh was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods well give me a break you know
my my opinion i think i think there's a big concern uh hopefully hopefully the new uh education secretary of education will do something to fix the problem but uh
but as you say it's it's sometimes it's difficult to to know if it's you know i think if somebody wants to say read these ten books because these are self-improvements i would probably be turned off to them
yeah we we have i think we we name drop it a little too much and and don't fully understand what what what it is we're saying i think it's it's focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and and all that kind of rolls in together there but uh
uh not that i can think of um i think i'm under my quota a little bit i need it if i if i make a phone call or two
my major source of information i guess is news excuse me
i mean let's face it today's today's uh means of communications we could uh very well a newscaster could very well give away away a
and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits and of bits and pieces of news on the air
uh i mean there there are times where uh video uh reporter actually will risk is life life and limb i've seen it happen time and time again
and he rides through the clouds you know and you see him coming out of the clouds his head coming out and then the bird coming out and it you know they're flying all over with it
yeah i read the book before so i knew the story line going in but
i thought you know it looked to me like it was a real submarine
yeah well they had some in some of those you know they i guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about and and you know and
they were giving out and they had a little pen there with animals in they could pet you know and they liked that and
going on there and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything you know all out in this in the in this schoolyard there so we just said hey let's stop and
yeah you it's it's hard sometimes at work because you know people say oh we're taking a cruise we're going here we're going there you know because they have a lot more money
spend all of their time with their kids and spend lots of lots and lots of money basically i think they they really spoil the child to try to overcompensate for their guilt feelings
i don't know uh i understand that the talking about leaving
um you know had some had some pressure against the but now they now and they wouldn't allow us to have a base in the region but now i think they're rethinking that
wage a war with us i mean uh it's one thing when we all came over there and said okay here we are get out
and you can't get away you just can't do it and get away with it and you know hoping that you know because it's a it's a world thing and and and and nations will combine against you
right i i have to think every year to try to remember what it was what's it supposed to like this time of year
you know on the local news he's says oh we typically get a lot of rain and we've had this many inches and you know we're right on target you know and
and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in but i you have to it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like but i guess yeah i wish i just wish it wouldn't come all at once and it and
right well it's just that you know when it rains it rains you know in you get these nice lovely rains you know nothing really downpours you know like downpours like you have here you know
i guess and it doesn't i think you know all that falling would warm it up and melt it but it maybe that's what rounds it i don't know but tumbling
i didn't notice anything strange i guess
last i've heard is that he's starting to peak right now
who's the other one that's doing so well this year is that i haven't seen them on much at all much at all but all i you do is hear about boy they have the scene the you know what do they have and
sometimes i i said i sometimes i wish i had more space you know i grow a lot of things a lot of food and
yeah i uh those onions i think we we planted like twice as much this year because
she made these onion rings that were so good and and and uh you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in that it's an ingredient and and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better
so because have you seen how much pickles cost in the store i know it i said why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers you know
i guess but we're going to try that and see how that works an experiment i'd like to try you know just try something new every year that i haven't tried before and
yep i really don't have any problem with you know uh people using firearms for sporting purposes i don't have any problem the only thing i am in favor of the seven day waiting period i would like to see that see that happen
um-hum that's true i i like i say i don't have any problem with people using firearms you know for sporting purposes or hunting purposes i just think it's just may be a little too easy you know to acquire one
they do well it was very good it just takes up you know like you say a lot of your garden area
oh i see okay we normally don't start anything indoors we just wait until you know the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground
yeah i'll have to admit i don't i do my own yard i i really don't enjoy doing that i enjoy having a nice looking yard i just don't enjoy the work that it takes to get it done
that's right i have a problem discipline you know i think now boy i really need to get out you know and apply something you know and i screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something that's right
yes i've for the first time we planted them this year uh-huh yeah yeah we tried to find them last year we screwed around and waited too long and i couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left but we've got some this year
defense department more or less mandated that people you know who work on defense contracts you know some do some sort of you know drug testing i think that's really what maybe prompted to do it i was in the uh
when i retired i know it was a you know it was a real hot hot item there i think i want to think maybe they you know really got some nudging from you know to do this sort of thing
when it first began or at least began was in the talking stage you know everybody knew it was coming it just a matter of time everybody was screaming you know invasion of privacy and all this stuff
it wasn't nearly as much fun when was playing for you guys i'll tell you he lives in the area now as a matter of fact
i don't know he'd be good at it he's such a motivator he he primarily you know with the quarterbacks that would be his specialty i wished i wished they could work something i really like him i really do
of the of course you never know the guys they pick you know may may never play a game you just never know it's it's a gamble it really is they may get hurt or not be able to participate at that level if you know
absolutely i don't know how they do it it's it must just take a hundred percent concentration i guess because they know they're going to get hit it's just a matter of how hard you know or where
oh absolutely they look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem gosh what a beating they really do take a beating they really do
knowing what you know of course was in for years and years as coach is knowing his or you know knowing of his temperament i'm just surprised he ever you know kept the guy around i really am he's such a he's about a half hot head anyway such a temper
oh yeah sure well you'd have to uh or i would have to say you know someone like i guess who's done so well for so many years
of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot of you know if he's got a good supporting cast you know if not he gets beat to death like poor old has the last couple of years anyway you know well did better last year hopefully they'll do better this year
that's right i really haven't been an active fan in several years i used to go take my son you know when he was in high school he enjoyed going to the baseball game
boy i tell you that would draw a crowd wouldn't it it sure would
but i didn't know if i don't think i've heard anything on the or i don't remember it if i have
well of course it's you know it's it one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do you know unless it's just you know really you know for and for their uh you know for their own good
it had to be done in a hurry i mean we didn't have you know like six months to check all of these places out
and uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should be done
but there is you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different uh container
i think basically it's a good idea you know i hope it works
as far as new stuff to recycle you know i don't really i don't really know i really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth
you know gosh credit cards run what anywhere from up to eighteen nineteen percent i guess
no i i understand it's becoming you know the popular thing to do we're not participating in that particular program at the moment and i don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to
getting a little more leery of credit cards you know as time goes by unless you just absolutely have to now there are times when you'd at least think you do anyway
that's right my wife and i really i guess are fortunate we're really not compulsive shoppers you know we we plan purchases you know pretty well you know watch for the best buys things like that
yes all all young they did not specify you know exactly what young means
i'm not sure they need to be you know paid you know a super do salary of any kind that that kind of takes away from public service
but just you know to receive a letter in the mail that says you know you need to report somewhere by next you know i'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea
but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information uh you know disseminated before you say let's do this you know
i don't really see the emphasis on things like like we you know we saw back i guess in the administration that was that was a big thing with him
i think i would be you know i guess really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say you know that
i am in certain cases in favor of the death penalty i don't know that it's a big deterrent really i don't know that it is i don't know how we'd ever find out you know really whether it is or not
i suspect i would be uh you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were you know brutally killed or something like that like i say i think it depends on how personally affected you know you might be by it
yes i think most states do have capital punishment yes
a lot of them had to have elected elected not to do so now i don't know what they do in place of it you know maybe it's
life imprisonment or you know something i don't i don't know how they handle it but
yes it would almost have to be i suppose if you if you had to chose i guess i would i am sure i would take the lethal injection
we'll probably never know how much it actually cost
yes that's really unfortunate it really is i don't know if we stopped too soon i don't i don't i really don't know what we need to do about that
i think one of them lives in and i can't remember where the other one lives
and my husband says i do it you know make afghans so i can keep my lap warm
if we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other don't worry about it we have a a very small phone company down here
yeah well it gets a little aggravating i've got kids all over the and and you know sometimes they get disconnected when i'm talking to them
as other ones so it's very it's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one other than i guess how you know how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class you know if there's some gauge that they could make
um-hum i usually just i'm trying to think of i guess i would tend myself to be more towards the the like three
you know if they had to have a rifle or was you you know made it more difficult to get a a uh a handgun
uh it used to be so so much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell you know rank and file in behind it
so it's easier for us to say you know to an you know uh you can't do this get back you know or we're going to force you whereas you know if the would've
a and if part of you know south let's say wanted to succeed you know succeed
well that's what they're saying the whole problem you know with if we were to demilitarize what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there
i think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury and to get to trial
yeah uh it it it's kind of difficult and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in in jail
um i don't know i you know i heard a very interesting and maybe it's just the show or movie i was watching they were going through a trial
and i think it was like on one of the the documentary shows where they ask for the the verdict by the jury
yeah although i guess it's your you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time
no i should have taken the the the you know uh option when that was there but it was just i missed it by a couple months
it's uh you know it all starts to become similar there's you know there's benefits and there's things that weren't as good but as an overall package i'd say i i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out
you know if i need to pickup and move somewhere else
i agree with you i think it had something to do with deregulation but i believe uh
yeah yeah transfer yeah to go from from eighths to sixteenths to uh thirty seconds and remember where it falls it
uh see i don't remember i i read it
well i understand but if it were told to us that we would find the time somewhere between our
yeah yeah you know how that changes
the the experience is is better up here i think you know it seems more relaxing there's more to look at
and you know how much you're going to drive every week
i think it has something to do with oil don't get me wrong
guy said well can you share it with us what what you find so funny he says well i already told you my sons a lawyer
dad you know how to tell when a lawyers lying to you his lips are moving
yeah so other political things that's going on i heard mister say uh excuse me say that he uh
what's that oh okay um i say back east you all drive at fifty five don't you see out here in the west
yes when i lived in every year i had to drive you know i drove every year to the gulf and you know so i could have a feast of fresh seafood
well i'm sure part of it is a male female thing you know i remember whenever i was growing up
those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight you have like bands i don't know if you've seen them they're
they put on these computerized one these computerized machines and you set a speed on it and the weight and it and it makes you do it and it tells you like if you're going too slow it will say my grandmother could do this faster than you
and stuff like a turtle goes faster and um it tells it and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you
you know it's it does a lot for you i think makes you feel a lot better
the system the system right now you know should you know is fine i think it should be by a jury i don't think the judge should have i mean he's just there
you you rarely hear you hear of course there's cases where someone has been put in in in uh prison
more than likely the people that are on the the jury know what they're doing um i mean you
i don't know i think the i guess there's a lot of problems with the
and uh or they fool the the defense in thinking that they're you know because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want
but uh if everyone would take it i think if everyone took it seriously
they have two types of water aerobics they call it aqua exercise i guess is what they call it
and uh she said hey go for the swimming pool she says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor she says in fact you get more
but i found that this worked really well and i came out of there and i saw my stomach going down well
like i said i like it i like the heat i like the
so you have a little you know little you can program the one at so
uh i it would depend upon which one you want i think now that i've had the bicycle
so that means if i knock out the wall
oh yes i mean when i had uh i was watching it the first time i ever saw a microbiologist on there i thought well it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities
um trying to think of i think it's in four places around the they hold competition and the only requirement
the only thing i guess thought um that i haven't been trying is when i you know go to take a shower to save the water and to put it on my plants which i had never thought about before
i missed that question totally i mean really bad i'm trying to think i didn't miss too many i can't remember what my score was but i did exceeding well i was surprised
well i was in uh the other day and what i don't understand is there is recycled paper in there and it cost more
what is oh i know it was toilets you know the old ones smashing them up because they're that stuff there is great for in road work
you know what i'd like to see a little more i don't have any little tiny kids but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now
excuse me i see it being done i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever and she's training her
were you watching i think uh one of the news stations i couldn't even tell you which one i watched but they had on there where the
in the chamber that's exactly right yeah well we we're trying to teach our daughter she knows real well about um
i mean because he's always you know if he's has them out cleaning them you know she can be there and he'll tell her how he's doing it or you know show her the insides and stuff like that
yeah i i think so too i think that's a bit dramatic but but other than that i think it it's a good idea to get them involved in the city and community activities and you know like the uh shelters and
pick up like on the highway and stuff and i think that's pretty neat they uh go along and have so many miles i guess of highway to take over and they clean it up
and keep it clean i think that's a pretty good idea and i think you know again i've seen a lot of young kids doing that and i think it gets them prepared to
that cannot afford to fix up their homes that need desperately need it and uh we go along with all the material and in one day more or less go in and say roof paint fix whatever we can
yeah i don't think that some people i don't think have uh a year in them to volunteer if you know what i mean they're not worth it
it wasn't that childish you know what i mean it wasn't my daughter's five i mean she understood everything she goes to almost all movies with us except you know rated and uh
i don't understand why they charge they they charge you out the kazoo for both you know popcorn is not that expensive when you buy yeah and so they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and
do you think my daughter would like it
yeah that's that's true they said yeah they said there's a lot that had been edited because of the length
no no i wish it was i wish they were in that instinct
if you do not pick the trash up you know the container and put it on a table or chair or something she'll knock it over i don't care how full full she is so it's not like she's hungry it's just she wants to get into trouble
yeah well we went over to her house so we told her you know prior well we didn't tell her we just told here we'd be over that day we didn't tell her when so
that way i didn't think you you know the house would be you you know cleaned or anything for me specifically
you know just how she treated them how how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and stuff like that
you know if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into into their school and they made sure they pointed it out you know
well at first that always kind of bothered me i mean not bothered me but i thought well you know i'd like to see what she's doing you know
right but i just think of her you know next year she's going to be five six years old in kindergarten
yeah uh well we have those um which i think is one of the best things is those cash for cans i don't know if you all have those around
a trash can and you know for people to put their aluminum cans in
at all i mean they're real hard to find the places that pay and that's really discouraging i mean i just go ahead and take it to the the regular place where it's
but they um i think they should you know they want people to recycle i think it's a
and when they were questioned about it they said well we're running late or we didn't have time to do those bins or something
but a lot of people do say i sound like i guess i have i guess more of a twang to my voice but sure am i've lived here all my life but anyway uh
and i said well i'd love that but
that's what my girlfriend says yes she loves that place she loves that she says that's where we need to go sometime
uh they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry and i just think how can you do that these these people have have given so much of their lives you know to
right i think it's neat i think uh you learn a lot from them you
you know because i don't have a lot of time but when i do get to sit down and and read i like to read the and i like to read i read to my daughter a lot too
yeah oh i think i know who you're talking about uh i've seen i don't think i can pronounce it either but
yeah yeah uh well you know who i'm talking about
so they're getting into it i don't know what they get for the tickets though
but my principal said since we're doing this thing called we're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all this
and his mother is carrying this on and you can get the information to set it up you know or join you don't have to join it as a group or anything i don't guess but you could start your own anyway get a a pamphlet
uh-huh well they're certain places you know where i know you can take your leaded cans but i don't know where they are they publish it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it
and i think do you have those up there
she'd be big i don't know what are you saying
oh my little girl is in the second grade and told me to tell you that means good-bye in the language
so we're getting a large oh gosh i don't know i think there's like twenty six different languages now that are spoken in i the
my neighbor let's see is and he's going through the i don't know or something and helping a family that's come over from
it's a is doing it i know i think don't they have some and supposed to start some pilot schools going to school year around
and then we you know we investigated this by flying some people out from to observe some of the schools in that already had it
you know now that's sad when there's supposed to be what you know one thousand what sixty five dollars something like that spent on each pupil
uh-huh i'd never heard them before until i went in a music store and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it and i just i heard a piece and it was just so wonderful and then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it
well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road we're going to go to and see a friend and then i'm going to go to yeah where are you
well i remember before i got married you know when you graduate from college they'll send you all those credit card applications you know of course you fill them all out because you're honored right and uh
i think the longest we've stayed out there is like five days and they even they had a library at one time out there
i think your voice sounds familiar
ten minute time limit and then well that's okay and then they come on and tell you and they they tell you got five seconds to say good-bye
i said how are you doing
yes you do well i work for and i don't know what you're talking about when you say um health insurance but doesn't pay it pays most of mine
you know now after you work i think five years they begin to pay most of it but then for the the family you know my i put my kids on my policy it's like two hundred dollars
and it's gone up quite a bit and they predict you know of course it's going to keep going up i wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage at some point
i think that would be an excellent idea and would make women go to work sometimes if they knew their kids were being taken care of they could go visit them during the day
no i wouldn't think so have you guys tackled your ceilings yet
i haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it on down so that you won't see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet because every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it
and we had made a list of all these uh baseball teams and the cities that they were from then i started cleaning and i don't know where i even put that paper i yeah i was just cleaning and throwing
no i had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything and i finally got to where i go okay i'm you know may i ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for
you know because you know you never know where they're going what they'll report or
and they'll tell you they've written something down and you
yes when i first started teaching i remember i went up to my job and i said okay i want to see a curriculum guide you know so i'll know what i'm suppose to teach and they go
and i go okay i mean you just you did what you wanted to do
yeah and no if you talk to ten then they come over on and say oh you've extended your limit and please say good-bye within the next five seconds
well yeah we did but the topic was boring i thought what would you serve uh if you were having a dinner party
you know for all i know aerobics started out here i don't know where they actually started but they you know the craze really picked up big here
well there's a sense of it being a package i think there there is a sense of you know whole there's a lot of uh you know you'll get
boy yeah that there's a i can say there's a correlation but i couldn't say which which caused the other they sort of developed you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more
yeah well i think so i mean you you've if you look at certain if you look at other cultures like i know a little bit about
and a lot of that is diet that's true yeah i mean they eat they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat um for economical reasons not for preference um
inherent politeness on the phone even with a machine i find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there
yeah and i one of the problems with the database was uh that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information i mean they said they would give it out to only select companies but
and they've really um well i mean i i wonder how people have sex and things like that i mean they obviously you go to and it's obvious you know the results of sex are quite obvious as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years um but i i just don't quite
well do you think uh i mean i wonder the assumption is that it is a problem uh and i've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem though i have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem
i mean i i assume that those who don't vote i mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote they tend to be you know poor blacks for example vote very little and things like that and i assume that they would vote differently
if they were voting than your average voter but i don't know if that's the case in fact i've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't
i don't know how i feel about that
well considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the and it's not for me to say that they're not um they they feel i mean here you have the right to vote and they simply define it as a duty there
and uh so i'm i'm really quite quite curious how that would work to have both i mean you know and i believe in the in a certain uh block countries you are are obliged to vote too in fact it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for up until fairly recently
that's what i think of when i think of you're obliged to vote but when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country with its two party system um
or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have i don't know the right to write your
uh republic documents uh when they were arguing through constitutional law written by and all those people um oh i think it was who wrote number ten or something where he was arguing for a republican
well i only know i have my friends who have had children uh i only know one woman who's decided to go the quote unquote traditional route and i have a lot of respect for her because she made it as a real choice
in most subcultures in that that i've been exposed to if the man were to say uh no i've decided not to work i want to stay home and do the child rearing my wife has a good job and i want her to keep that
oh yeah i've i knew people who did it years ago but they they were very apologetic about it because you could tell they were used to people kind of going what are you doing that for you know
and i think most people make better parents when they're a little bit more mature i really do
stuff toward i mean i don't know if if you saw those but i thought she was treated badly at for being a woman frankly i really did by by uh
but really that's a previous generation i don't like it's harder to imagine people of our age doing that and not feeling really stupid
i mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways but really it's the entry into adulthood i think and i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to
you don't want to have someone making a personal choice in that way i would hope i mean because that means someone the personal sheriff doesn't like doesn't get to have a gun and someone the personal sheriff
but if you're not a very if you're not a basically good citizen you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway
and uh you know a kilogram weighs about this much and get used to it from scratch cause i still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters but i'm perfectly comfortable using either
uh i believe so yeah and i think they did it overnight cause you know you can't do it gradually that's an example of something you can't do gradually
pounds come in the the you know the odd numbers you know two point two pounds or something i think people will start getting a sense of gee the metric is the sensible one
they don't have and i never thought well i guess that is something you need to know you know people getting into trouble because they come here and so they start farming on uh available land you know like the median strips on freeways
and uh they have you know so i do have a lot of sympathy for them and i feel that could try a little bit harder to to help people adjusting to the way because if they don't you're just going to produce
yeah it would be a good experience and you'd be helping people i'm sure very much and and i mean not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the groups are having a lot of trouble i mean and part of the problem is that
um and if it's you know uh just people helping people i think makes makes the community so much happier
so there's less you think now there's less of a a social movement and more individual movements lots of individual movements in a sense
and at the same time i think there's there's there's a growing environmentalist movement
in terms of you know some real landmark bills passing and things like that such that you know people cause thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now i mean my generation doesn't
yeah well i'd i'd say actually i mean as someone who's involved in education i'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the
a real low income sort of job and very low prestige i mean there's that that old saying those who can do it and those who can't teach this is the way of let's make fun of the teachers those are the people who can't do anything and if you have that kind of social attitude it's
even if it's in a genre i don't like i figure well i should go see it because if this is you know the best of the genre and i should know about it or something like that and i usually come away thinking no i really don't like this show
yeah it is it is and i guess you don't have to but you know if you look at
oh i would have liked to have a kid with me i think preferably someone seven or eight just just to get a sense for you know how how it affected them
very very badly they lose control of body functions they thrash around they scream you know uh it's just a very very bad thing and they never present that even the movies that want to show violence as real they don't really show you what happens with that real violence
uh on the one hand i'd like it to be a warning on the other hand i wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee now we want to see the aftermath all the time either
but yeah is sort of the same way they i guess they figured i mean they know what they're doing and they make the movies good enough i guess i'm a bit of a snob they make the movies good enough to be successful
and i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom the from older to younger generation it was it was a classic you know it's mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with
and i think it's i think i can think of movies i have less fun during and then after the movie's over i remember it so terribly well because it it had some some meaning to me or something
i mean i don't know if this is old fart talking here or something because i'm not that old i look you know those old movies seemed to have had something that uh that was memorable somehow i don't know what it was
okay well um thanks for hearing me ramp i guess all right nice talking with you
and uh don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to to air and all that
i came back and they said the record showed i served but i was out of the country at the time so i'm pretty sure i didn't
so it's it's uh you know saying well look you know we don't like the way he looks and let's uh let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff
and you also get a lot of um juries are extremely uh and from what i hear i i have i have some friends who do expert witness testimony
and they say that uh juries are extremely vulnerable to uh sort of emotional pitches you know the prosecutor will want to uh
oh i don't know show the show the mugging victim you know show what the nice person he was and what a family life and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim
oh of course it's it's political maneuvering the the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will you know want to hang everyone and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic they're not looking for someone whose going to be the most reasoned
or sensible or rational juror neither side wants that they want to find a juror that's going to uh be most persuadable by their arguments you you know
or just you know just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that you know they just say do you believe in such and such um
yeah it's pretty tough it's pretty tough i mean uh let's face it you know and you know are you did the you know as far as i found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know it's what you do
you know they they like what they're doing they you know they feel good about what they're doing that type of thing it's more
well i mean like i say if you're if you're you know if you're at an upper level in the rank category you know you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year
that's why they can say you know there's no layoff policy
well they're the standard right now or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of a lot of times and the main
yeah i've seen well i've seen them around anyway you know
and it started raining and i was hysterical i was i mean you would have thought a child had died i called everyone i knew i had every friend i knew in the apartment searching for this cat and they laughed at me they thought that was so hysterical
oh oh i can imagine what did he shoot him with
and he was the last one she carried across you know the whole big sad story so of course i had to take him i felt so sorry for him after that and he is uh you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers
and down at the bottom he said of course i love cats
really i mean i don't mind them i don't do drugs anyway i guess if i did maybe i would but
yeah i guess so i guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences
it is amazing i guess there are people that do that and they are those are expensive tests i'm glad i never had to pay for one
the weirdest fishing experience i ever had and uh people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught we were in uh which is close to
and uh we'd been fishing in the canals and all we were catching were catfish and we were pretty bored with that so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here we'll try to catch some crab
you know i would love to to be able to read more because i i enjoy it so much but with correcting papers and and i two of kids of my own i just don't have time but in the summer i try to read a lot
it's right that's right i find though that if when i find an author uh and you don't read a lot of fiction you said but when i find a do you
i know i know they don't
we you know we like i like it there and i think has enough to offer that they don't have to hog everything so i'm glad that they're staying in
well not really now my son does i have i have a son that just turned sixteen and he reads everything he gets he gets his get his hands on he's reading a book right now because he's a real big fan he's a basketball fan because he
he plays for the high school he goes to and uh just loves which not many people do so but he's reading it and he's reading and he says he's so interesting mom you just can't believe all the things he's done and
he's really enjoying that i and he said mom you need to read it after i get finished so maybe i will
and so i'm not doing it as much as i need to but i i can tell you when i do do it on a regular basis i feel so much better and so much healthier
and i i was i would go faithfully and then i missed once then i went back again a couple times and missed another time and then kept missing and never went back again i think if you you just have to stick with it
it's kind of a vicious circle isn't it yeah i find too that i have more energy when i exercise and i and uh you know it's silly not to but i don't know
it's just a put off i don't know why i don't do more and i and i know that it's good for my health i know you know from everything that you read and you see on television now exercise is so important to good health
that was what i wanted where i could have piece of mind and when i taught school and i knew my kids were being taken care of yeah and plus i
so you need because you need that consistency when they're young like that and it would be ideal like you you hope when you have children your wife gets to stay home i would have have given anything if i would have been able to stay home with my children yeah you are
and it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store will you take
yeah and that that's wonderful but what if if that wasn't the case what if we would have lost thousands of young men would that would it have been too much of a price to pay for that i don't know and i think there are a lot of things that we don't know but
yeah i think that's true but i think there's a lot that we the public doesn't need to know i think there's some things that we shouldn't know just for national national security sake
and i you know i think that if we did know i think there would be a a lot more chaos than there is because i don't i don't think people could handle it so i think there are things that we should not know that the masses shouldn't know but i also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too
see and i don't know i don't know i can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it i mean i thought the war was going to go on and on i really was surprised when it ended so quickly and
you know i've heard from many people that we could not even begin begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours
i don't know the answers to that those questions i think they're tough and i think you know it's i don't know that anybody knows the answers i think they know what they believe but i'm not sure they really are one hundred percent sure
well i'll tell you why i feel so i feel strongly about this topic i don't know a whole lot about the immigration laws but i do know that in the where i live and i teach school
people they allow in the per year or if there's even a i don't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore do you know anything about that
and uh with very very good school systems and they're considered you know one of the top three in the state both of them you know and it seems like a lot of the make sure that their kids go to these schools
are really tolerant more tolerant of and than they are of the for some reason they feel you know like they've taken over they feel like uh you know they're taking some of the
and i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i hi i really do wish i i knew more about immigration laws because i have no idea any more because they've changed a great deal
perhaps and i and even if i really wish i knew the situations they were going back to or coming from you don't know any of that and you feel you know you can't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them unless
uh my good friend calls them pushy but i call them very that they know what they want and they go get it and in stores and so forth
um they take something that you had in mind to get before you did you know just going for it they take it quickly and uh they don't think anything of that and i don't you know that's makes people resentful too and
um-hum well i you know since i teach i see that see it and and i feel and i love the example that most of these children and give the
men do because they can do it just as well you know if they want to dedicate their uh most of their time to that they're they're they can do it
exactly exactly and i think that's the way it should be i think it i mean not that i think that i'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that i
and i guess they've been using them for six months now and i've known several engineers that got laid off and they said
yeah well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a in how to get a job after he was through the whole process for for several months he did eventually get a job
i've got fourteen now here at and i hope to make twenty five but say if something happened to me i mean
well turn turn in your forms go right to personnel i don't know whether you have to about an i don't think so
i'm satisfied with the vacation i don't know what else you know you nice to say you get another week
and it's a salesperson at least you can chat or whatever and say okay now we want to go and then when when they actually start off with a a computer and expect you to talk to a computer uh that's where i draw the line i just hang up immediately you know
yeah they have they they can erase all your others you know because if you have
and other words when i when i do my chores i put the radio i'm a radio person i guess is what i mean and so i listened to was it five seventy which has continuous talk on the weekends
of course of course they could say well i can't give you a card and you could say fine but you know some things will be private you know but he said just put and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your
uh of course that would really be a big thing in a public school but uh i'm saying certainly at work i have no problem with it uh
uh and i think it is they they found that it's been very low really
i guess maybe at the locations though i don't know if they have it done but done it by location i don't really know if uh they need to publish that really
but i think that was an actually actually a good thing that happened uh i never considered it i guess it's an invasion of your privacy but it's something that is for the good of so many people you know to have everyone uh take the test randomly and uh
yeah i just got a little booklet uh this not what we're supposed to talk about just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts and i thought oh i better make some calls
yeah and that one's really super now i know what they're talking about on regular retirement yeah there's not too many they do have a wing where the people who are really sick you know have nurses
oh that would be awful i never thought about that you know
i've seen on where they take animals and young children in fact my daughter is one my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school took them to an elderly home and and boy that really pumps them up that uh
and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old and i guess she she had her own separate room and i think whether it's more a custom up there or maybe because i was younger and it's just not a custom anymore
to have uh you know the grandparents live with you anymore i guess that uh well we are getting away from that which is not right
that's what i think about it for me i think well my kids better not do that to me i don't want that you know so i think of it well how would i want to be treated rather than
and we keep thinking about that you know because she they get less alert and they don't care and i've seen some of these elderly people on you know the ones from that just run into people and they don't even understand what happened you know
that's great well it's wonderful in one one respect but i don't know if you can afford the insurance yeah
i wonder if they should give them a test or at least maybe uh not take their license maybe give them a refresher driving course and just to just to see how well they are every five years
discussing you know what we do up in to get something growing you probably don't have to do much over there the soil's probably so good
you might have seen if you've seen the news today about all the tornados here that were north of us
uh i don't know if you get i don't get but it's here at work in fact i'm at work today believe it or not
and the weather men yesterday were all alert say hey there's something really terrible going to happen and they they sure were right but it wasn't in it was
i think they all were planted by the classical and uh
i think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop uh
no i think uh i uh work on my own cars and uh
well you said you were car buff uh i think that uh all of us could use one electric car right now i mean today because i think uh
and i was so interested in the auto show i didn't think to ask anybody there were no electric cars i was surprised but now that you just mentioned that
i've seen some i think then again i'm surprised now i didn't think they'd asked anybody when i was in the auto show
uh my car doesn't go to a shop you know it it i just do it all do i uh there's hardly anything that other than putting tires on that i'll do i did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but i change the oil and transmission and
and when i i just overheard what they did for me very little because i didn't take it that much but what i heard them tell other people was always right
did you get it inside or outside i i took one off my little i had and i pretty much took it loose on the inside but it came out from the you know underneath the hood it came from yeah
i broke mine you know so i'm always very careful when i change hoses on it i don't know whether you did yours
but i broke one on my on my and i always remembered it was my own fault and i thought well i'm going to to going to carefully take those hoses off
uh uh it was a air conditioning stopped i i just heard it i realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in
and so sometimes you have dumb luck i i was you know you could have taken something like that and thought well the compressor's not working or it would have taken me all day probably if i didn't do that but sometimes you have some dumb luck you have a little curiosity
i've always said i'd teach them my my one daughter was fairly interested i really haven't gotten around to i learned because i i just uh learned you know and i feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things i'm going to do that i i told my daughters in college this year
was you why they they didn't say buy it they didn't necessarily say buy it new they just said what would you buy you know
i uh you know they said they said what do we want to buy i i'm uh seriously not seriously thinking but i would like to put it in that category uh buy a but i wouldn't buy a new one and you know of course if i had the money i'd be happy to by a new one but uh
and i think they're a lot over rate and their's no styling to them that you can't tell one car from the other they all look alike you know i don't mean that as a joke i mean they really all look alike and the adds i don't have any idea what which car it is
new truck you know that big big one that was uh they didn't have a price on it nor did they know had a it would cost it had a microwave in it and everything it was just it was they had several futuristic cars
i've got three of them and uh i can't remember one i think i had one someone welded a muffler on for me in a years time i think that's the only thing of the three vehicles that i've in it just the welding on like i said i don't do that you know
yeah i'm keeping eight eight engines because that's what i know and in fact i stock the same part i'm like a little stock if you brought your to me i could i'd probably have some parts for it right now you knows
when she ever there's something i say well have you read the directions directions i say well engineers we we are the few people in the world that read the directions yeah
simple uh you know again you can read it in uh a lot less than ten minutes it's usually you can you you can page through
he was kind of an arrogant arrogant guy so i think the newsmen uh enjoyed uh writing about him on his way down you know
uh uh i know what you mean really uh
during the year well yeah well in bad weather you know well you'd have to do something inside do you work at
oh i don't know i guess my husband got a letter at the office
yeah clocks is what i meant i can i'm going crazy my daughter's playing the piano and i can't think
yeah my husband keeps telling me to i went i went back to college a couple of years ago so i sit and study i sit in class and i have really ballooned up since then and
yeah tell me about it tell me my lucky husband's putting two of us through isn't he lucky
right yeah i know that i saw in a book i was reading a book uh not that i read you know i just you know reading some words and there was a comment in there about
the don't really want us to say we're they would like to say that we're because they're too you know and i guess that's true we don't think of
when you certainly can speak their language uh and there are problems with you know the wet back problem you know for everyone knows what we're talking about when say wet back problem and then we should somehow
uh and i think the governments are working on that to try to have some uh businesses uh at the borders of both sides so that you can you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here and to to get the jobs you know there there may be some organized way to do this
i i do feel for them uh they are very envious of us or they wouldn't be coming up here you know risking a lot not that they're risking their lives of course but risking a lot uh getting thrown back i guess is all that uh happens
are you teaching what you said what were you saying you were teaching there
oh yes i know they change with age i know mine changes uh has changed uh although you you never found your your voice echoes in your own head which is makes it different than what it really sounds to other people uh
well i guess i do i do have a long term budget because i got a daughter in college and one going to be in college so that i've been thinking about that for quite a while now monthly monthly no i'll tell you a funny story about budgeting uh
uh one and i always tried to show my wife you know here's how you once a year i'd say here's how you do the budget in case i get sick or here's how you do the checks you know
it's just uh like our band gave money away we're a band booster club we gave we give uh two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids uh who we think were worthy you know so
uh we have a friend who works who is a secretary for you know up here they give you scholarship a hundred percent
you know what the what the guys name is uh who does financial work all over the most people haven't heard of i mean you probably haven't either unless you're a radio buff uh
my wife i you know it mentioned the the question was uh do you get it from people too and i i can say the same thing you do that uh my wife is uh she reads the paper from front to back and so she'll tell me some stuff and she'll always get mad and she'll say you didn't read the uh
she's always reading something and she says why haven't you read that and i say i never have time to read it like you do but which i always get a lot of my information from the newspaper through her
and then they would always say and look at this and there'd be pause you know and and you'd hear music and stuff and i realized it's the exact commentary that's you have on on the news yeah
i think the same thing should happen for uh i'd like you know that would be my answer of an easy way to to get these guys out of there for twenty years my it's ridiculous you know
i think gee whiz you could make it a couple days uh it's just uh if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them a couple of days
i mean uh i don't know if you like the mayor but i think your mayor the city council the what is the woman's name whose uh not the mayor but the
oh yeah but but those are the ones that are complaining i think a lot i see it here at
what are the issues i i'm a i want to just say that i'm so sad that there isn't a strong i don't even know i could i could go out and
should you know let let them go have a semi pro team but i think i'd like to see college athletes let's talk about college basketball i like i like that if any basketball that i like i like that i i don't i don't like the pros at all
uh the high scoring there's no defense it seems like and they just kind of score a hundred and twenty five points you know the other team scores hundred twenty two you know and i don't really
yeah i like high school football which again again is is not the subject but that's so much fun to watch because they're they're the the pure amateurs you know and there's no money involved you go to college you don't really know it it loses it somewhere
and and they seem to be there's articles in the magazine and all that about whether it be basketball or anything else if it's not making money then we'll do away with it well that's that's not i thought it was you know so that you give them an education of that particular discipline
yeah i talked to the professor and i asked him about it and he said oh he says i think i'm the guy that actually uh gave it to all my students so that's why so many people are from this college uh go ahead you you first
just because it only takes a few minutes to cook you know you get it ready you have to do a lot of work beforehand i agree and buy special stuff but uh
oh yes we probably ought to try this but it probably will never taste as good as we remembered i guess it gets better and better as we remember it back as we get older you know but we probably should try it uh to do that uh
the recipes are really interesting you know we're probably going to lose them we'll probably forget all about them you know since we're trying to make everything so simple here i am talk about trying to make everything easy you know
you know to have a meal and we were on the way over we were just married that very year and she said oh i'm looking forward to a nice turkey i said turkey i said we don't have turkey at i said we only have turkey on i said we're going to have a ham she said what
no i uh i've i know about but i think goes
we've never done that you know and i remember that when i was a kid uh to have the ham cooking uh rather than that we just ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally you know and that's it you know
i say if i have four eggs not not for me but if i'm making four eggs uh even for my daughter and i i'll take out all the yolks but one
and they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs and i think that's what helps you know that that you know warning when you have a drug program
but uh they say that there it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and and they're not you know in other words there's very few mistakes and that of course has got to be critical it's got to be
no you don't want to do that it's got to be you know a laboratory that do quality control and and double check and i think that has has latched themselves up with an established group
you know first class totally independent agency not local of course ours i think well i think it was in in the south somewhere but it wasn't even in you know the one that did us yeah
again before you go you know that's that's why i said when they first started it they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and if you may have taken drugs
give it to the kids for free you know and get them sucked in and then they sell it to them you know the classical thing is to give it away or i always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party and they slip it to them i i don't know i don't even have that much knowledge to know
the the key thing that i think uh we try to do is that bring all the friends over here have our house as a place where they can come at any time
well well good luck with your your expected uh baby there uh my wife was yelling in my ear was talking in my ear she said uh reminded me to say that uh they're very cheap until they get get to start driving
was it five dollars a call or something well hope i hope they follow through and everything
right yeah they're supposed to do what we say but they do what they they want to do really
i think that's a wide open subject what i think that uh people need to take a stand i think the people will here shortly uh
uh well i just have an opinion now i didn't think i i thought the terrorism thing was overstated i mean there was nothing over here in fact even
my wife when she talked about the and everyone's afraid you know of how the war was going to go and everything i said i said i told her no it's just not going to happen there's not going to be any terrorism over here and there wasn't you know
and and the last you know out of all the we brought in there there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from from and i think that there's got to be some sort of controls over that i mean this mafia thing is getting out of hand
uh i'm sympathetic i don't know what the answer is i guess i'm sympathetic certainly with that that that they they want to come over here and they i guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work
and if if they have if they have jobs you know i i hear the story about they're taking away jobs but i don't know
i think that we should have good relations with with that's not really exactly immigration it is and it isn't uh i i don't know to what degree we owe
uh have this tremendous border of and then in you know they they speak their and all and they try they go out of their way to try to speak their their neighbor's language so they can understand we we certainly we don't really even make an effort
i don't know if it's costing us any money or how much money they're putting into it uh that's always a factor i mean how much my wife says they how much the federal government is putting into
uh ancestors that came over that way or not all but i guess uh i guess if you go back far enough you came over on a
i don't know how much immigration we have from and everything what the controls are
uh although i guess now that the is falling apart that maybe there'll be
so many of the people who will go back overseas you know maybe it'll average out i don't know
but i think it was just plain greed and i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks go ahead loan your money out you know
that was the philosophy you know just keep spending until taxes are lower and i thought that's not going to work you know and i knew that it wasn't going to work originally
i guess i'm dealing with too many mechanics here i don't know really i'm i'm being a i guess i'm i'm letting my come out you know
i think that not not only but a lot of it when they talk about uh there was one point i was going to make i think the last i heard and i i have to admit i'm not as informed uh that much but there's something like eighty six billion that they admit well i always double that i figure well
oh yeah i know what you mean
well we're in the metroplex here you know and uh it it i die every time companies like they they lost several contracts and and i don't know if you noticed yesterday
but it wears off and the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic you know uh it starts off with like a tic and then it gets to where he can't you know control his movements at all
and so graphic i mean i hadn't even imagined it you know i think we've all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo
really and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this this beaten down path
well that i guess it it doesn't
what they're trying to say is that there is a great deal of
to deny that at least you know the majority of it is true so you know you know it depends on how you look at it
i don't know if there's a there is a time limit on this so uh
and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living and she said oh he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff
for our people come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it
and so it really made me question as to what how do we know about you know uh if the news we're getting is any good
if they if they had it i don't even know that i'd probably read it even if it was at the library though you know i i just you know i'm just not really interested in reading about other people's lives to that degree you know unless maybe they lived a long long time ago
uh yeah it was it's in two parts i think the first one is called or something like that uh because that was her name and um i only got to read one part of it and i've been looking for
but i love to read i mean i'm constantly reading i read i like uh mysteries and i like
classical works that i hadn't read before you know that that you might have needed to read in school but that i just didn't read for some reason or another another or that you know that you can only
that you you know you never get a chance to read and so i said well i think it was because i read um of and i just
i mean that even when i read it now it still makes me cry the ending of it and i couldn't believe i i could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book i'd read some before but i hadn't read that one and i i was like i thought to myself
i guess because it seems like uh older people have much better
in their schooling they they got more of the classics than i did you know and she knows so much more of them than i do i wouldn't even know you know to go look for that author or that book
uh purely for entertainment you know that's it i'm not really expecting to get anything out of it except to be momentarily pleased you know because i don't i can never remember the plots or anything
so it's basically mindless i mean all your you the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you you know what you're hearing and your your sight uh your sight but they give you everything else and
but i really i really get mad at myself when i do because i realize i realize fully there's no really redeeming value for no
yeah i like a lot like i like uh the the music like with um uh the um um i don't know if you've heard
i i can't identify them either i just like them i couldn't i know which ones come next but i don't even know their names most of them i don't know their names of the song but i i can identify them but i like that and i like um
no no it uh no i don't go to uh i got a degree from but i'm really interested in legal you know in the legal environment but i don't want to be a lawyer so i said well i think i'll go back to school and
i i have seen things i really like you know that were done
but and i mean i'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that because i can remember when i used to do you know those little salt dough figurines and things it was it was relaxing you know creative you felt very creative
yeah i think maybe if you were somewhere like where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants and stuff but here basically you go to an restaurant or you go to a restaurant you know where you can get foods that
you know where you have a little bit more variety as far as the pastas or the the corn meal you know or something
yeah yeah you have to watch that too all you know some of the restaurants here they will you know like you can ask them and they'll tell you whether or not they use like lard or you know animal fat to cook with
so but so that's that we don't really eat out too much we we tend to eat at home and actually you know i think we we we get a have we have a healthier diet than the average person
whereas we eat say broccoli you utilize all of it you utilize your your body accepts all of the broccoli
yeah plus he eats we both think more about i thought more of about it as far as what it was i was eating
well no i don't think so i think it's just your because i i prefer to be waited on too i just if you're going to go out to eat why not have the whole service you know why why not get the whole
yeah well i i've my that's the way my mother stands on it she feels like if it's something that you have to do you know if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes it becomes a chore and and she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore
and yeah and it's and it's more regulated i mean you're you're using different parts of the body so it it is like dance and and it's structured like
and someone else is telling me okay you know let's let's move this way let's move that way instead of me having to think about it so much
do you think the program came first or the
so do you think even i mean what did you do when you were younger did you go do the board games and stuff you still did what you do now
but i mean do you see yourself having thirteen kids or twelve kids
or manage money or know yeah know you know how to get how to even go about getting money you know how to get a job or or you know
sometimes there's an advantage i mean sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent you know it makes you know that you can't take anything for granted
you know how we're affecting the and things by what we do as the people and and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot and that actually um
in in a town adjacent to ours and i know people that work there that of course you wouldn't think would put out certain chemicals
but when they pollute into the air and you've got you know and you've got movement through the air it's going to move a lot of that off so i don't see
no i'm not sure i know it i think it's uh i know we have a piece property there it's called it's in i'm not really sure what the county it's no
because dairies they don't the the it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free they've got to have them there to be able to milk them and they and i read in this article i couldn't believe it where you know like one cow produces like
one cow i was like my and they and this thing says that that you know if people think well cow manure is good for fertilizer but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not it's not
but when they get them in these tiny little areas you know and they've got a real big problem and they they said that that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff and taking it to uh these
so that just creates you know there there's and oh it was just disgusting it said the creeks will foam people people stand outside their houses and their watch the creeks foam brown and all and i'm just like oh my gosh and the smell is really bad they say
emphasizing the problem with acid rain you know if we if we keep putting that stuff into the air and and you know if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for um
just the the you know what the is receiving back you know because how can you tell where it's going to come down at
yeah i think we just have to i don't know personally you know i suppose you know if you just make sure your car is
is working properly and you you know they're suppose nowadays they have the emission controls on them but
their family came from there and how they feel about you know our intervention and their governments and stuff like that and he he was all for it because it's just like you say uh there's so many people there that that
you know that it it does help i mean you know i think the people in those countries do want our help the people that are you know under conditions that are you know not favorable to this their rights
i don't mean to well i guess i do in a way sometimes i think a religion has a lot to do with that i think that that uh because of those countries countries a lot you know where such influence and i think the religion itself
you know they are the ones that set the rules set a lot of the rules and they are the ones that do keep the people down i mean when you have a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're
i think they are they do tend to be more educated much more educated than
um yeah we had cat you know my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my mom developed an allergies so i mean i'm used i'm used to having cats around i like them
well when i was you know when i was growing up i had a clean the cat pan all the time and i hated it because i had to carry everything upstairs and you know and use this thing to you know scoop the take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible but now they have like this you get these liners
but they're not that much fun you know you can't take them for a walk you can't you know they they don't they can't fetch you know they can't they can't do anything so i've never
no it's like i just i don't know i just never understood why what the attraction i mean they're you know they're pretty and everything but i've just never seen the attraction of having fish
i forget how she got it but it was um it was the same kind of a deal i think she got it i think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department
yeah i i have friends with hamsters and gerbils and they they tell me the same thing i just again it gets into these aren't much fun you know what i guess they can be i
you know mostly because i like the because i used to live out in you know like i like because i like you know i like the city
yeah it makes sense because you know you you've got the flexibility if they're good athlete they can you know do a bunch of different things
you know if you go to i you know i'm sure if you go to any of the twenty eight coaches in football in training camp they say oh we're going to be coming in i know in baseball you know any manager you go to say well we're going to be in the even though you know they don't have a prayer
um i really don't like a whole lot at all and um i mean i'm really they're they they got a big thing because of the you know the the expansion going on in baseball is like
and uh he had this cartoon in there about big day you know the first thing is the phone call from the you know from the league saying he was uh um
yeah i've never been the farthest south i've been on the is so i um keep wanting to get south further you know i thought i would go to a couple summers ago but never did it
i don't know when we're going to have vacation to do it
yeah i was i was just i mean most of the people i've talk to are from are from so when i you know when i heard you were from i was like oh okay there's somebody different and you said oh i got somebody down in i go okay that the connection right there
oh i don't think there are any trying to think if there are any minor league teams down in that area and i'm know real sure there are
i don't know i've been i've been sitting here thinking here because it was you know took a couple tries before i found somebody well you know i'm like i'm not really sure what i think about this um
i don't know it'd probably be it'd probably be good i just don't know if you know if i was eighteen or whatever i'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever
well i guess it's going to depend on how i mean if if you're talking about any if you're talking about something that's like a full time
you know one year full time you know this is what you do you know you're going to go and and fill pot holes and you know and you know all that stuff i mean
yeah well uh it was it was interesting because that's an interesting question you know should these people be allowed to or not i think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed
it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may may make some people realize that hey you know this stuff runs out
so um you know we're acutely aware of a lot of this but you know on the other hand he voted for so um you know i i wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing
yeah i'm trying to think what i've seen lately i mean well well we just finished watching uh on tape you know
we we saw an we liked it but you know i didn't think it was as good as all the uh hype was about it
i'd like to see those i keep you know um you know there's like three movies that i i keep telling myself that i should see one of these you know some day that i haven't seen you know that that are classics you know because i've never seen and never seen
but um i think one of the movies we saw recently we saw uh
that was good um oh it was great and it you you you think you know for a you know it because it was by it would be really gory but there's only one well there's a couple scenes
um don't really know i like a lot but uh i'm a big i'm a big baseball fan so you know after and of you know um although you know
huh well i'll have to catch it one of these days you say you you said you seen
i saw it you know i saw part of it again i mean i like you know i like i like and uh there's this one there's this one actor it's really silly that i enjoy him a lot but i i've really enjoyed him in everything i've seen him in a guy named
um you've probably seen him and just an you know oh that's who the guy is do you remember did you ever see
uh from that's used because going to film school and uh in his classes they're using there's a bunch they're running a bunch of scenes from and then he's running into who is playing you know this you know this uh organized crime head
yeah well especially you know well of starts off you know in the eighteen forties you know and it's like wait the war wasn't until the eighteen you know it's like okay yeah realize these things drag you know these things take awhile like to move up but it's
i mean i have you know i have everything he's ever well almost everything he's ever done
and um you know i i know that when i you know when i get his book i'm i'm usually going to enjoy it
which you know when i read it i should have realized that because i mean it had style written all over it yeah
think at least not by that name the the but i don't know if they play in the same location
it's uh something we're really irritated about around here or some people are really irritated about they're they're building this new stadium they built the new stadium downtown and they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium
but i park for free up at at because i know where i can do it for free
do you read um i guess you read but you don't read many sports books or
yeah and uh i was thinking about there was a i saw a book kicking around on the history of the which
and and i mean by saying i like them i like their chances i actually don't like the i'm a fan from from way back
and um you know saw you know saw the and last year and a bunch of teams the year before
but that's what happens when you get up in this area you know you got all these companies are up here and these they i guess they know they're going to get it
yeah that's true especially well well is like anybody else you never know how long you're going to be here or be in one place you know
oh yeah because you're combine uh confined by space you know i had a i came out of a thirty one hundred square foot two story house house and i had room for everything
yeah you can yeah you know you learn you adjust you figure out
yeah pretty much and uh there's never really any any oh i remember in school there's just seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night you don't run into that up here i think i think because there's so many uh professional people if you want to call them that
uh sounding music it didn't have what you know i guess what i was looking for at the time country tells more of a a story it kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up and i've i've become i guess more of a country fan over the years
carpentry work to uh uh some types of furniture and uh oh i don't know what you would call them knickknacks i guess stuff you hang on the wall and to put a mirror on and
i know seems like she i think she made three this year one for uh my and and then a couple of brothers and sisters so uh she those things they take some time to make
i think i had four uh jalapeno plants last year i think one of them died but i i got
so you know i put them i chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because i don't there's no way that i can eat all those and nobody else in the family likes them but always got to keep those planted
i would think so um seems like these all they all went to uh to leaf and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit so i don't know if i'm mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon you know but i don't
uh extensive in car repairs in oh oh probably a year or so i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the water pump on an
yeah i know what you mean
no there's no way somebody once said uh i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it and a woman asked me what that meant and i said that means that i can't work on it you know they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that uh
well that's kind of the way i was i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went and i don't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together
but uh i remember working on those cars you'd open the hood and there was basically nothing in there but an engine and a few things you open the hood and it's scary like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes
and he had never really thought about it he says well hopefully i won't have to change them before i trade it off it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall
i haven't had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be uh better than having i've got an an that i think's got six belts on the sucker i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump and uh
i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where
yeah i haven't gotten any calls in two weeks so i don't know if if it's tapering off or or what is i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting uh answers so it sounds it's taken them ten fifteen minutes at a time so
that's true i guess well there's there's probably two or three different types of of views as far as the controversy goes i can see where
if a life was taken by accident or uh i don't know what you'd call it not premeditated or i guess primarily by accident
and you know the last i heard it was costing ten twenty thirty thousand dollars a year uh to keep these guys waiting
and you know the like you say the cops that are out doing the work a day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work basically go out the window
uh i don't go to movies a whole lot but uh i went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw with which turned out to be an extremely extremely good movie
yeah it's it's something that uh my my brother lives over in and i was telling him about it couple of weeks ago and he said well i'll wait until it comes out on uh tape and and rent the the video and i said no this is not one that you want to do that with
no it's it's one i think well you know every every now and then you find one that you say yeah this is my favorite movie well this this is the one for me this time
well they they do they get i remember when we used to go to uh see well i remember when came out when i was a kid and and some others movies like that we wanted to jump in the cars and and race
and uh what what exactly do we you know do we see about this world or why are we so fascinated with the other world is it just supposed to be better
yeah sometimes i think we we think it is and we like those things that way
well it has all all the way through history there's uh i guess if you want to call it mysticism or the occult or whatever it's always fascinating i guess because we don't know and there's no real way of finding out well there's only one way of finding out
yeah they say uh she said that this was uh almost believable that could really happen you know you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things and it you know you never know
well sort sort of we're probably like most families i guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got at the end of the month and we know what bills have to be paid
but other than that uh i i guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome of just putting everything on there day after day after day and then then you really get socked to it if you don't watch it
but it you know you kind of you know that somebody every month and who knows how many people are looking at those uh
and they i guess they figure they've got enough people out there with cards they're going to get cards at uh twenty bucks a pop
we hope every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through in a way has done some of that
or uh if if something happens that that adrenaline really starts flowing they say hey we got to do something now and and start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few few minutes
they did so i don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the the team sometimes it brings in new motivation and and you all you can do is get out of the way because here they come
i guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and you've got the time and that uh
i have even considered you know babysitting myself i have a teaching degree and uh
thought well you know i could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to
but in i think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed
from been experience with i mean someone else certainly you wouldn't want your child's day care person to yell at them and scream at them and say do this do that you know you'd want them to
and well they don't call it remedial reading these days they call it something else but but anyway at the time that's what i taught and um
and you don't know if you were reaching them or not but we felt like you know maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them was better trying to teach them was better than have them taken out
well i spent a year and a half in also and i've seen how their school system works and i they go by a complete rote system you you just memorize everything
yeah they allow it under certain circumstances you have to to prove that you're teaching them something you have to follow
you know they they will allow you to i can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence and maybe if they was a group of or something like that i don't think they're is in in this area but
so you know like you said we've been paying these fees and not going so it's kind of a a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it
oh with the walking i think they they said you need to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically
oh okay well then i don't know how much you've been through it but um i think parts of it made a lot easier
and i think the exercise helped
okay i hope your baby goes well comes out well bye-bye
uh well good we've both seen one did you cry through much of
i was telling a friend i said i only cried twice but each was about half an hour long so
i i think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character i haven't watched um
i think uh yeah i think so which in you get even though the the person is involved in so many other people's lives you still see a a real person in those situations he gets
yeah i think most shows were doing that and then they went away from it and now they're starting to go back to it and maybe that's what the public wants i don't know but i just
fills up any time of space i get too involved in reading sometimes that i neglect what i should be doing so i you get so involved in what you're reading
and i it was just too much to start with and i still haven't finished it because i stopped i stopped and i thought well i better do some simple things and work up to this because it was just so difficult to to get it done and there were so many different shadings and colors and
yeah i was reading when you called um how about movies do you like to go to movies
the bureaucracy in running it you know how you going to cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then
but i don't know if i was doing it
in different situation you know not a really religious background if if i would get a lot out of it you know i think i did because it you know it emphasized that sort of thing you know a lot of
you know so i love the big city because you know i had lived in a rural area for for so long so i've enjoyed it
the only thing that i use is soapy water you know spray the plants because they say supposedly that will keep the bugs off them
nah it won't hurt them i i was a big dirt eater supposedly when i was a child and i turned out okay so don't worry about it just let him enjoy himself
well i i really did enjoy it uh you know it was amazing what i found out i could do on my own if i just put my mind to it yeah
so that's that's really why we ended up in a house like this his is not what we you know what we want to stay in forever because i have to have my i've found that after doing this other house i have to have my hands into stuff and
well let me ask you when you laid those bricks i know my parents bought a house about ten years ago they're fixing to sell it again but and move again they're kind of my mom's like i am she's a renovator a lover of old things
was not laid on a like i don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something under uh on top of the sand and then lay the bricks but they have they have a problem with these little tiny like sand bugs or something
as tight as you can that's probably because they had you know every spring my mom says we're going to have a party a barbecue and tell everybody guess what we're going to we're going to redo the patio you know we're going to pull up all the bricks but uh they just they just haven't brought themselves to do it
but uh i don't know of everything that i did i guess i enjoyed probably wallpapering the most and i thought that would be the hardest thing to do but um gosh you know i ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house
so have we we have redone that thing from stem to stern i mean inside outside you know we've redone the body repainted it detailed it so you know i really haven't thought
yeah that's true i i don't know it just seems like uh you know for what we've put into it i feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more than you know yeah yeah
and uh i don't know i think it just soured me on it for some reason because i had trouble with it starting the engine blew up in it i had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so
you know i i thought what the heck you know we'll try something different so
you know so uh uh hopefully it'll stay that way i mean you know i'd i'd i would hate to see the car industry suffering more than it already has
yeah twenty thousand yeah yeah well that's what my parents are avid freaks they had uh and i think my my mother drives the now that's uh i guess it's a couple of years old
yeah yeah and she it final just wore out they had they had purchased it i don't can't remember how many years they had that car but she loved the styling of it
my dad said well just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it i mean he came back with a new car yeah i think he had an ulterior motive he could just see you know dollar signs starting to to flip by as far as repairs went but uh
that's wild you know you you hear about things like that and you think that can't possibly be done i mean it just that's just too weird
right uh-huh so you could tell the what see the inside of them or whatever yeah
i think it takes a talent to do that you know my my husband is uh engineer but he cannot i mean i or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it that's might be part of it but uh
you know we just i just say forget it we'll just take it in and have it taken care of he drives drives a
well that's to that's one thing that when you would consider see when i go out to think about a new car or buy another car i don't think about well is this engine that i can work on or that you know my husband can work on or whatever
i think that's correct there i relatively not existent from uh from what i hear from my friends it seems like uh
and uh it's just a matter of of trust you know i think they feel that these people are um under qualified basically and underpaid
when you hear people say it alters your life forever please take heed and realize that that's true so it's uh such a responsibility
but you know it's it's funny i did i had a friend that said you know before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other and she got older she said but you know but we never do those things anyway so
i think it takes a lot i don't know i think your patient level must needs to increase as the child gets older i think that might be part of the problem with some people
that's amazing it's amazing that people actually the stamina that you must you know draw from yourself to deal with it it must be interesting i guess you find find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought maybe
well i you know i'm living in a dream world what do i know as i said i don't have kids and i'm an only child so i've never been around children
so uh i'm sort of at a a loss where that's concerned but i do hear my friends talk about it
well that see i didn't believe anybody would believe that either i guess i have i have a hard time coming to terms with the the fact that the public really
right right but you know that just made me think of something that happened down here in last year they have this huge fight going over redistricting here and at one point they did they took another vote on it
it was just a just happened that we were exhausted and they wanted to watch and we said okay well we'll sit down and we'll you know look at what you want to see let's just turn it on and see what's on we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it
i know i'm trying to think if there's anything i do you know i do like i like um stuff that's on and i we used to watch mystery quite quite a bit and enjoyed that
that was just the rule and if they saw us watching something they'd say all right what did you see on or there was some other the children's program i think at the time was called so we had to give a little oral report before we could
program yeah they do have a good they do have good writers for that oh that makes me think do you watch at all
because i think i mean there is a night and day difference between good doctors and bad doctors and good hospitals and bad doctors hospitals and
and in at least at the time i was familiar with it about ten years ago they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was going to be
right that's exactly the problem there's just so many such variation in it but you see i guess what what they had in and i guess in is socialized medicine so maybe that's like the extreme of it do you think yeah
i don't know i think we have to have something i really do
so is i guess yeah i think that's the legal part it coming in to too that i wonder if we should have a limit on how much people can sue for
well i guess it has a lot to do with a lot of the stuff that i find out that i'm paying for now you know
well yeah that's and it's uh it's funny because a couple years ago i hear a quote from let's see if i can remember it anybody who's not a liberal in his twenties has no heart and a person who's not a conservative in his fifties has no brain
i i don't know maybe other people i do you think it's a sign of the times that people are starting to say alright really we really mean it no more taxes or maybe is it just my own personal
yeah but i tell you um we have incredible property taxes down here
uh what do you think about what you see on about them like in the news or on the ads do you kind of just
or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues
what if some of the newspaper articles or the i don't trust as much but newspaper articles can show whether how they voted in the past
and but you get you know it all depends again on whose writing it and who they're for because they can slant that too
do you think um i mean what would it take like that this is really good actually that for to talk to somebody who hasn't voted i mean what kind of
how would it how what kind of stuff would they would you like them to do so that that you would know more about it like send stuff in the mail or have it at the library or
i think everybody does it just depends on how well you can hide it
maybe somebody'll vote for them that wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side do you know what i'm saying so they just try and make it a personal thing i mean if you remember
you did have you heard stuff about him lately do you know what he's doing
oh good oh good i was just going to ask you how it you know if you liked the the obviously you do or you wouldn't have him there i know but
yeah yeah so i felt real good about that but uh boy i tell you with summer coming up i'm just pulling my hair out in terms of what i'm going to do i i i guess i went back to work about a year and a half ago
kindergarten next fall and she says this is it you know i'm not going to have her anymore and i said oh no don't count on that after noon classes she's going to be here because she's going to morning kindergarten so
and then there would be a whole ton of other kids all in the same room you know and its you know what having fun they had with these computer games and then they'd go outside for awhile they had snacks and story time and everything but it was just like going to school until five thirty at night
full time for a whole week but she she's gone three mornings just doesn't go there three mornings a week but i said to her i said you know it doesn't matter if
oh you mean so oh i see so everybody could stay together yeah a house or something
well um did you was it hard to decide what who to invite and who not to invite i mean did you have to draw a line or did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line like they just whoever wanted to come
sure sure no that would just be a few but how about like because of divorce and stuff like that like my parents are divorced and they're both remarried and you know there i mean there's i don't know
so i mean i couldn't give an accurate i couldn't tell my kids what you know those people were like i just remember they have some funny stories but i don't know who it was
yeah they say oh dad let dad cook mom let him do it but um
i know my husband did too his parents are and they uh always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table
um i don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening we had the same kind of problem if you make homemade bread i mean forget it's supposed to save you money but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat it tastes so good
yeah uh-huh i've heard of that i've heard of it but i've never done it
i know it sounds it always sounded i don't know how safe that was sounded pretty bad
i mean i think they're doing their duty but i think if they're going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it
we had one in that was sentenced to death and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago i don't know if there was anything in your paper about it
yeah you wouldn't even dare put these signs in the window little emblems in the window saying child in this room in case of fire you know have you seen those
well they did have one woman dean but and i guess she she probably did very well but
she was a little perturbed about it at one time i don't know how she's moved away i don't know how it is now but i know uh
i told him let's face it you're a house husband that's what your going that's what you'll always be
i think maybe more men would like to be if they weren't put down so badly
i think we are programmed to just take it as it comes
i know i know what you mean we don't eat desserts much any more
i i kind of feel the opposite though i wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things i think our elected officials say they are speaking for us but they're not speaking for me
i think they feel they can criticize if they don't
i know what you mean i like some ambience and
i i am too i wish uh it had started a long time ago is the the problem because we're so wound up in the in the system that we've got that you know trying to convert over
and i guess what'd they try they tried what'd the call it soft conversion and hard conversion one of them is where you just take whatever's already standard and you give it some sort of a weird
i kind of remember back when gas prices started up uh you know pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range somebody had uh i believe it was
when you finally figured out that liters what about a quart there's about four liters in a gallon you know so you can figure out what you're actually paying for it
the uh i think maybe there's where the the problem came in you know we uh tried to instead of learning it's kind of like learning a language you know when you learn one from the other
yeah except they've got a now okay there we ran into some problems once i remember uh they've got a a nut and bolts system called
i thought maybe they would convert to uh metric back when they went to the fifty five mile an hour speed limit because what is it fifty six or fifty seven's a hundred
well you know it's it's it's real confusing right now to know what kind of a of of a threat it is i guess it it takes awhile to to get used to something
you know if if they have completely changed the place has completely turned that much around to where they're not you know not what they used to be uh
yeah i think you know the the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so uh dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute you know we're getting uh sucked into something here you know if if somebody's about to
to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know we're we're ashamed we're not going to do that anymore and uh
uh you know he's he's let some some stuff go you know the east situation it's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible you know if i'd have been asleep for five years and read it in a book i'd say no no no that didn't couldn't have happened that way
yeah i think you know what i'd have to i guess i guess to answer the question directly i'm still just a a little bit
you know leery of the whole thing what i haven't seen is the uh you know a great stepping back in the military situation you know it's it's one thing you know to let us go ahead and
well the the situation you know the when it looked like that thing was was turning around and then all of the sudden it was like somebody in the
you know and i've heard people say well you know it's just like the will there be a union or not well no it's not the same sort of a thing at all because that
as as we are seeing now with a lot of those areas wanting out of it you know they uh nobody voted you know a lot man those people didn't vote to become part of the they had no choice
you know by force there's there's no no real question about that and some of the countries that were forced in at the later dates is the three countries you know came in in the forties
and uh the said well that'd mean we get to bring in forty eight you know and uh that sort of you know they backed down on that
yeah well when they went to the started with the newer engines you know when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much you know trouble because the three fifty with all the
nut i'm trying to think back now i read an awful lot of uh
i i wasn't really aware of it's being you know terribly uh you know rapid at the time that that i was down there i think that really kind of developed a little bit later on
yeah i understand what you say there was a uh
they had uh kind of uh i don't know if you call it stand down or whatever but anyway they stopped
yeah i don't know why they expect it's going to start this week you know
you know until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but i don't think we want to make that decision either
no i guess if you make money at it it becomes a vocation then
i don't don't know where they came from they come out of nurseries mostly in and places like that
well i tell you what now see there's two parts of and and are almost identical in every way weather and everything
uh a part of the system you know if you know in a democracy where you know people have kind of uh a freedom to sort of do what they want you know there's there's an inefficiency there
uh my attitude was kind of one of you know these people are you know taking a tremendous amount of my time you know and i've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again
and uh it's kind of these intervention programs now a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism and that's communism and that's you know and then it gets political
view i'm sure that if you you know ran on a platform of you know we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them out of the home and all yeah you know how far you're going to get with that
or something like that or they don't care you know mamma what guess what i did in school today well who cares you know
you know not so much at what the schools are teaching but what they let the kids get away with you know they they see most
that i took the greatest advantage of you know what i went through there
i know my dad always talked about uh he was in uh during uh the depression and he was uh a rock rib type republican and the only good thing he could ever say about uh the
well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know what would you have who who who would determine what these people do
well you know they they had a group of people who were construction oriented and they went and they they built uh can't think of a good example a swimming pool or anything
you know and one you can you can only build it in one place you know and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream well you didn't build one over here
yeah well like like i said at the beginning i've got so many connections with people in my is you know and they have situations like like that down there where they
yeah yeah right he felt that he really had an in so you know he things he would do with an airplane but any rate that's off the subject no i haven't seen i haven't seen
oh i was gonna say cause i wondered if you really you know if you had any teams you like watching from up north or something
yeah yeah that's where i've seen it because i've seen it off and on probably
yeah we we bug our we you know one friend of ours got rid of his because we motivated him because we you know because we were getting along without ours so he sold his but uh the rest of our friends we go and watch them
i think a lot of people go in debt because they think oh you know i can just charge it but really i mean if they don't have the money then they aren't going to have it in a month so
um i think has a lot to do with changes too don't you in like people's attitudes
and it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams because it was like they played so much smarter and more disciplined i don't know if they won very many games but
i'm kind of racist i guess when i say uh i like to see the white guys do well you know instead of the run and gun all the time
yeah seems like you could set the the score at a hundred and then give them five minutes to play and then it'd be the same result you know because they they start they shoot so much and then the last
yeah i can i can i know what you mean
from the people i've talked to i don't know if i should bring this into it but um a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more um where they could manage their own schedule
i know my parents are growing up i guess they never spent much time watching in fact i've never seen my mom turn on the we didn't really have one very often
my dad had his own business and it was easier for them to do that but i i don't know it was i guess i didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time
because like i know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them on the bikes and i don't know if that would work for me because
i don't know i wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain but you know it's really hard to find something that works
doctors about family and you know how to improve your home and all that kind of thing um i like to read the magazines i to read like i like to read i read a lot of bicycling magazines
uh i don't remember it was i had my parents buy everything and i ended up it was their table their kitchen table it came out really dark
i think my parents took me there when i was real young we went to and uh it was real pretty
uh oh oh i think i know who you're talking oh i know who you're talking talking about she's got black hair
yeah okay i know who your talking about i can't think of her name either yeah that was that was that was i remember that being uh here a few years ago
yeah oh yeah well yeah yeah i think they're i think they're a bit too over exposed i get kind of tired get tired tired of every other song being on the radio
i oh we we watch those award shows too we like we enjoyed watching the country and the and stuff but i just i just don't care for him i just never have i don't
is is it okay uh i think i know who that is uh-huh i think my parents have have uh some of his records
think there'd be a market for i i'm sure you could find old players for them but that'd cost a fortune if you could find them that worked oh
i don't know anybody in my immediate family that has or you know has ever even thought about it do you know uh do you know anybody that's been it
i don't know how we got the subject you know i have nothing to say about this
well i i mean it would it would have to be tough going somewhere you don't know
um-hum well you know uh i know i'm now i'm working at now and they
you know help them grow in other areas
uh others people don't know what they want to do
i guess i suppose there's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives
but i think a lot of it's you know when the people get older they'll do something like that
i it's it's interesting we got this topic because i i i don't know what i marked off to get this but
uh there's you know from the he used to be the general manager starting the
and uh i i still can't figure out how it broke and uh
i don't know what you want to call them fake
but uh yeah because i think it's all funded either state or federally funded so or uh obviously so
you know there's there's not enough room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it they think they need to
no yeah i know what you are saying but i'm just saying that even the differences uh is that you know some countries pay for students to go to through college and etcetera but here
you know we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board uh
bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute obviously there's uh uh you know there's a lot to learn
they maybe they need to uh help promote that more give incentives like uh if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is you know for them to train people
but uh you know most people i knew have gone and got their degree so
you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh like still does not let us compete fairly in their country
i think you're you're going to find that just because the you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh
i ought to open the paper here because i know i've seen a few that have that played but um
i haven't heard much lately i just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews
so you think their quality control's going down over there uh kind of
and those things just keep ticking i mean they just it can rack up a a hundred fifty on them and they're still beating on them
so i think that's what uh i i'm going to have to get next time around i keep i keep holding holding off i mean i could i could upgrade now if i wanted to but i just i it's just such a huge expense and
it just depends i know that's what i want but i don't know if i'll get myself to
that's the only one that i you know i see you know i see uh you know early on that that that says it says you there
okay yeah i got off my pace or my cordless phone anyway uh hope it's not going bad it's going to bum me out um but he i think he he only spent you know the low twenties so
well i don't know i think the demands gone uh down a little bit i think you can the prices aren't as high you know and the the was first introduced uh
thirteen standard you know and you get your options you're looking at fifteen or sixteen fifteen but there were you know people were buying them for nineteen and twenty
i think there's another car coming in it's supposed to come out and compete with that and i can't remember what i read about that but so that's interesting i mean i would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular so
uh-huh i'd say do you know
in a voluntary field like the i don't i don't know if you know remember about the
i think it it would bring in a lot of uh people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in in other countries i think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their their brand of crime
on i don't know what you'd call it other than on line they had them all on hold and if a child asked a question that the person in could best answer they would cut to that person and that person would answer the question it was just very
that uh i don't know if they still have them but they were free rental videos that had something to do with the war
my fiancee takes probably six papers takes both papers an paper both papers i guess he takes seven the paper and the paper
well i think the war ended too soon
i just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet that i i still feel like there's more to come i don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned
yeah it from from what i can tell if they had gotten into it it would have
um well i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season and from that point on uh
having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to have behave differently and their manager assumes they have a drug problem i mean if someone assumed that of me i would be upset
but but see they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the what the drug testing schedule is they say we we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here
and i thought well i was doing them a favor by taking them
there's just there's so many capabilities out there i mean the things you can do are endless
oh the one of the reasons why i got mine was before i went on maternity leave they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because i
it's uh yeah we we have one in the office and if we want to use it well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to had to change it uh put it on a disk
and the the guys that that some of the guys that run this place are very tight and it's like well why do we need this can't you do that with you know what we have and and when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good
i don't know they they're going downhill pretty steady
i guess as long as as uh they're fighting each other we don't have to worry about them wasting their time with us
you go to high school you you know you work you go to college you get out of college and you get a good job and you work and and none of this you go spend two years in the to expand to broaden your horizons
i had this topic and i didn't feel like talking about it so i hung up and i guess they they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it
and i can't even i can't even grow an ivy my grandfather gave me a plant once that told and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill you could freeze it you could
oh yes but we try you know uh i try my husband also we're involved in everything our kids does because uh
my dad died you know when i was less than a year old so i always just had a mother so i always thought when i have kids you know i really want to be involved with them
you know to do it and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while because you're saying well i work full time too you know
um nursing homes to me i would personally be the last resort you know i really you know if i had to put someone in there
but still there's those little things that happens you know there really is which i think it's a wonderful place you know if it comes to that
yeah yeah yeah but i think when the time comes i hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at
i think that's wonderful i really do just as long as they can and then on the other hand i've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know
yes and like like i said my sister's still in it and i really don't think my mother want to be there either
well i hadn't either we hadn't you know like i said we hadn't i don't even guess they've even thought about sending schedules out yet
getting paroled lets say in so many years i mean if your going to sentence somebody lets say twenty years let them stay twenty years
because some innocent person can really it seems like really serve a rough time you know i'm not saying innocent person let's say someone wrote a hot check for instance
seems like left out in the cold more or less doesn't it in a lot of well especially in things you pick up the paper and you read you know you think oh my goodness
um no i think now now you go to work when they're six weeks old you know and you stay there and i feel like the next generation you'll probably just work right along with your husband you know
yeah i kind of think maybe in time that you know you'll go by social security numbers you know and that way they can't say well they picked the male over a female or female over a male you know you yeah yeah
yeah but i can remember remember back growing up my mother i mean it was she always worked but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off
yes i know uh i have two children i really try to watch what they watch i really do because my youngest one he watches something you might as well just plan on staying up all night because you know
okay oh yeah i had been through but um just as far as you know watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad
i know um people i think nowadays people just really just murder is nothing to them you know
you know that's huh-uh but something i do and i it really is i'm like you astonishing what the younger ages know and they react to what they see at home know
no no well well uh our kids are kind of still small now and we had thought before when they get a lot older we don't need such a large house
but uh like i said otherwise you know a the the expense but you know we could not had one as large as we have if you know we hadn't did it ourself
and we did it that way then when we started having children we bought a camper you know and we did it that way
me i haven't really as far as entertainment i don't know what you would do if
um-hum i like to read too i was trying to think of some while while it was uh talking about it and then i it took so long for someone to answer i started reading the newspaper and kind of forgot about it but uh
yeah it takes a lot of concentration i mean it was the type of thing i was i was making some little things for and i also made a little thing for a baby gift and uh i thought oh i can do this while i watch wrong
no you must pay all attention to what you're doing it's it's it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be it took me uh quite a bit of time i thought oh this won't take long at all but i was wrong it took while it took a while to do but it was fun i enjoyed it
i guess if i had a house i might enjoy gardening
well i enjoy playing with my cats i don't know if you'd call that a hobby but i have two cats and i gave them a bath tonight so they're a little bit angry at me but uh they didn't like it too much
yeah oh yeah right in the tub and and it helps because it's the time of the year that they're shedding a lot and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine so i thought well this'll help you know help them shed and
in there's definitely a crime problem i know it's you know worse in the larger cities um it's kind of a concern for me in fact at the moment i'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment and uh it's
right we have enough enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is so let let their country take care of it we don't have i guess too much trouble in with well i guess i guess we do have a lot of people come in from
but they at at the there i said is there any area i should avoid and the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl and said
i couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place they said the crime apparently the crime is just uh
hum-um and especially not in some of these big cities like in i mean they've had they're up in the top top five i think of cities that are getting policeman killed on on in the line of duty and that's really sad
i had gone over to and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the in the fleet program and and what you could expect they said you know a five percent
and i went the next morning to and they gave it to me for that price and what's so funny is they took the car they i knew they were gonna pull it from because that's where the white one was and they had already told me we located one at so it was that same car
went and took the car because i told him there's a place in that's gonna give it to me for that price he said no they're not and the next day they
pulled the white car and took it to so i'm sure he knew so i loved it i sat there and i just had the biggest grin on my face
it's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise i know what you mean
and they run for two months at a time and you have to you do have to pay to take them and i took i signed up for one that was three nights a week an hour and a half so that was four and a half hours a week
since it's more expensive i think okay you spent that much money you'd better go
and they have ceiling fans in the rooms and it's it's a pretty nice setup um and of course it's real convenient because it is right there at work i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere i'd never make it
well the i don't know i think the probably have a a better team they just at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with getting hurt because uh just couldn't never really get it together
i think it i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on but anyway they're trying to keep him
about eighty five was when they started kind of going downhill really but you know i'm just used to always growing up and hearing and you know and all this other stuff so
i can't you know i'm not going to decide i don't like them just because they're having a few bad years i mean i think they'll pull out of it and you know they'll they'll wind up being good again they've got some lot of really good young players that are going to
i didn't really think about that i just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper
you want to be with the children yet there's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think oh but if we both work we can get a really big house and we can get two really nice cars we can take a vacation we can do this and
but i don't know if he took that out of his vacation or if they really do have a paternity he put paternity leave up there but it might have just been him describing the fact that he was taking vacation days to go be a father for a little while i don't know
that's uh i think i think that's getting a little more common too
i agree well i think we've we've gotten our five five minutes or six or seven or whatever so
i think that you you make of that what you wish and you can go the opposite direction and uh overdo all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which don't belong in the uh at least in my opinion
i have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how and so uh uh i just feel that uh you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort
and then i listen to it when i'm in the car driving to work because again there's you know there's nothing else going on i might as well listen to the radio while i'm driving to work but other than that i've i really don't
the the information that you get from your child you know they they bring things home and i was never one to believe everything my kids said you know about something
uh she showed me a paper that he had just handed in and she told me what she had requested
we know what trouble they got into
i wish i had some to spend
i don't have a lot of time and i don't really like some of them to tell you the truth i mean i don't think they have any redeeming value
i guess uh there's some uh things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly
i'm not that hung up on most things i mean if i miss something big deal
yeah i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon and i noticed all that grass coming up and i thought ooh we've got to start this mowing bit soon
but i think the highs are gonna be in the sixties and the lows in the forties
well i think probably more people you know would participate if they just made it a little easier and like you say make it um
yeah i i'm guess our city you know in picking them up must take them somewhere else and get something for them
you know let them have it from one end to the other vehemently but uh it has quieted down but i don't think they probably feel any differently and some some of them did quit the company
i guess the one that really got me too was that uh let's say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine that's not allowed
yeah that's a good deal where do you think this is going in the future i mean do you think things are going to change or are we going to keep
i don't yeah i well i see i think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children uh and even those who may not do it seem to be
uh but i don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers you know sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are i don't know if they want to completely give that up
well yeah i think they they like a routine of sorts
i have a who runs a nursing home but i've never actually been there and i know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow you know a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about
well yeah i've talked to my mother about that several times lately and i said well i want you to have control of your own business
so i don't know it's not all bad but i guess once you get ill then you know you really
yeah i guess there's a lot to to think about when you're trying to make that decision
well and i guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know you
i mean they permitted they i believe if i'm correct i believe they permitted to carrying concealed weapons
well then tell me do you consider yourself a liberal
uh anything anything else cross your mind uh i guess most of us go by the audio which is the the television television or the radio
uh remember how they started out running three four hundred dollars
well anyhow i guess we both agree that that it is it should be in effect
uh i wouldn't swear to it myself but i thought it i thought it was in effect
uh i wouldn't know but uh they i doubt very much that they're they're using it now in fact i'm sure they don't
but it wasn't too long till she uh found out she could wait until i let her out in the morning
and uh i don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not
yeah that that's that's so true i mean they say well you voice your opinion uh uh uh on election day
it sure is and i think here at we get what is it nine or ten
i mean they're they're paying out this money anyway
i mean they get they get all these days off now give them
and said well we'll cancel it just like they did to the that debt here uh last week
well uh uh your you said your family was grown uh all grown up now how about when they were younger did you go camping take them camping
but don't tell the i said that
well you know what they say about the weather here in
well up until a few years ago i guess there there was uh there just too many liberals about and permitting too many
uh uh taken care of we had a a a black man was accused simply because he resembled uh someone who stuck who who held up a uh a a i think it was
and i think that it might stop us some problems later on i mean you know you these kids will get their their heads on straight and and figure out what they want to do instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something
and you know you you wonder where are the parents in all of this
well you know it's just like you say there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country and uh you know if if you could have a thought of something like uh
you know they you know they need help they don't have anybody to depend on and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house or do minor repairs or something like that
sure i mean i mean the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money you know that i i remember when i was a kid i used to do little little things for the old folks around the neighborhood and uh i know how it made me feel
and this was back in the eighties i don't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that
so i said well it just crossed in the mail so i didn't do anything about it weeks later i get another letter even nastier
they uh they they used to be good i remember when they first opened up they did have good bargains
i don't know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar we call it
if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree i don't i don't know what advice i'd give them go to the school you'd like to go to that's what i did
yeah it does i didn't know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree um originally i had planned
and from that point i went to law school and after a year and a half of that i decided i didn't want that either haven't figured out what i want to be when i grow up
yeah i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet i said uh i couldn't do this everyday no way
yeah well i got i got tired of the service after a while i mean it i had a terrific job really enjoyed it uh uh command post
i guess i guess these are going to croak too since i've got cats i decided to get some catnip
but we didn't you know we didn't really start it for the money it was just they were fun to have around and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds and
and i i just think that it's kind of i don't know it's kind of cruel you know they just they just breed these they breed them before they're ready uh and
hope hope the stud will find her attractive
that's it that's the fun part trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with can't just go out there and say okay you guys breed you know
you know and plus it also depends on the district you're in as i mean on the i've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do
i don't know back when i was going to school uh you just didn't get away with things these kids get away with now
well i don't know what can we do about it
yeah i mean they're they're throwing more money at it now than ever before and things are getting worse
well i think i think i i mean what we've turned the schools into now are just day care centers
they don't understand what i mean their politics really isn't politics it's religion couched as politics
you know uh we sit there and and we think that they think the way we think
we're we're going to be we're we've already been overtaken but it's going to get even worse later i mean looks who's looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the the math and the science and everything it's not us
you know we we've got folks running around here who get who get degrees in basket weaving and
i don't know it's to me it's amazing i don't know what we're going to do as a country we're we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later
well at a price tag of six thousand bucks i don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers
yeah well you know they they that's what they said about you know no no it's terrible you'll have nightmares you know i watched last weekend me and my roommate we we laughed about it
yeah and of course i was i was living alone at the time and it was late at night and scary and you know you start hearing noises you know
i mean i think i think the only i've ever seen a sequel was and
yeah no nobody could figure it out i mean the the book was so much uh there's just things all you can do is put it in words you can't put it in pictures and a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you could say what is this
oh the book is really good i mean i i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again and that's one of them it's it's so well written
yeah i don't even rent them you know i i figure if i find a movie i like i'll buy it because i just watch them over and over again
you know something i come to think of it i don't think i went to the movies one time
and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the click as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on
now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in
i don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have guessed i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get
i mean you i know you've heard this this slogan um if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns
i said the restrictions i would like to see on for anybody whether it being for handgun a rifle a shotgun i would like to see them go through either
i actually it's not it's more of a police action in itself the fact that everybody's packing a piece is a deterrent is a deterrence to someone saying well i'm going to mug this guy right here but hey he
say a person uh starts uh uh get all of a sudden my combat antenna goes up and say i've got the vibes this guy's fixing to do something i go ahead and pull my piece
well everybody's known has known they've needed renovation for years but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it
they want if i mean if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter i mean there's
but you cut you know the the kid's having to give up his quote play time to
um-hum which is the one that has modular type seats you know which one i'm talking about they have the commercial on where you can you can pull some seats out and you can move around
i know my brother doesn't and he has one in his car
one thing that i that i am curious about is um reading information on air bags do some of the vans i think i don't know about the but some of the vans now now have um driver side air bags
i know that's that's just like kids you know you you they know that they're not supposed to do it but they're going to do it anyway because they know they're not supposed to
and i we knew it but we never even thought that about when we got the dog we just saw him oh he's so cute let's take him home you know and then the first weekend we had him we had we were in a apartment in a two bedroom apartment
that they think is good they'll get into the trash and then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it and how how tight you have the lid down on it they'll get into it
how much do i have to pay these guys you know this month you know this you buy what you can afford i mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash
you know we started we started i mean we started this last year
but i think this they way the whole economy's is going right now it's just not good to be in debt
i know his his folks did a lot of traveling across country you know they went to the and and did things like that
i don't know if maybe i'm biting off more than i can chew
if you were if you were closer i'd i'd i'd tell you you could come over and supervise
um you just never know when you might come into contact with one
and i think i think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future
it's it is that like you said the divorce rate is getting so high
yeah that's what i think too i don't know how you feel um we moved here from another state we've lived here before went out and came back and that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax
and what you find out is there's one evil's the same as the other here you don't there's no occupational tax but it's a heavy sales tax so they get you coming and going
and then i don't know how you know in terms of when you all do your federal but it just seems like if you're strictly middle income it seems like you get hit the worst
oh i thought you were going to say something they somehow seem to get around the the things that we can't you know that make don't make that kind of money
i was reading about him in the paper and i said well you know he knew he was making money somebody he didn't look that stupid why didn't he pay his taxes you know
yeah i can hear the accent now i hear the i hear the um we live uh we lived in for about five years we we originally lived in and we met and got married and then
yeah but like the town home we're in i don't know how i mean we this is it's like a duplex like a two by two they call it like in and it's nice but it's i mean the girl bought it for a hundred and ten and now she can't sell it our neighbors
yeah i think that that's um i can remember in when this has to do with homes uh indirectly but i can remember when upper was out in the you know
um but it's just again the the privacy you know um we had a house in that was on three acres and my husband was raised um on a working farm near
um but i mean they have one of the um when they said log cabin i just laughed that they retired to but they built one of these i mean it's just beautiful
i mean my brother lives is it called or i mean he lives all in that same area going from um it's real pretty up there it's just
well i guess it depends on what age i'm in the thirty something so i know i mean i lived through it uh are you old enough to know about the war
see actually i don't really know that much about it i just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media you know um i guess i think it was not that great that we were in there
one of the things i didn't like was the weapon the weapons i can't even say it the weaponry that systems that they used um it just didn't seem that um
i don't know technically we knew what we were doing either then you heard about the things like agent orange et cetera and you'd think
the money's after yeah i mean i think it started actually like like in the late fifties i mean like in fifty eight fifty nine
and i don't know then we went we lived in uh for five years um for my husband's schooling and graduate schooling and it just it's a lot cleaner up there but um
i know i associate the pollution with weather in general so i guess one thing we do miss is that's a smaller town and it was it was just it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere you know
how strong the maternal instinct's going to be they tell me it's going to be strong do you have children
so what we're hoping is that um i mean my husband thinks i can do it i've just never worked out of a domestic base you know i've always been in a corporate uh environment
so do you think that i mean do you think that that was in a way though good objectivity good objectivity that now that's doesn't really that's not a correct but um you know in a sense you see what i'm saying though from a mother's standpoint i mean in a way it it was quote unquote good objectivity objectivity
yeah it really does and if you're a little bit claustrophobic but uh i don't know i mean the jails are crowded i i'm not a criminal justice specialist so i don't know what you know what can be done i'm
and you are wondering how you know um we lived in and i mean there was all kind of i know i i know it is getting worse i do not know what the world is or is not um
and the child had and he they said that he was twelve years old and he had uh he had not uh displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever you know and you are thinking to yourself um i know
i would never yeah you just don't don't even bother it's not worth it uh the when we came back i don't know if you have seen i was in the super market this morning and on the cover of magazine there is a girl
she she looked anguished i mean it was really just sad i mean didn't pick it up and read it but i should have but i just looked at the picture and thought what a world
they have a real big thing here people i mean even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting you know they everybody wants your business kind of thing and my husband is the kind of guy he's
no uh but i mean it yeah i don't know i mean i i guess i could go on and on about what to do about criminals uh i think the handgun i'm not real big on guns myself so i mean
i know and then you think i mean i have i mean i can remember i haven't been out of school that long but it has been at least ten years and you think to yourself was it that bad back then
i mean it is i guess it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that they in that is crime where they videoed that is probably one of the most bizarre i have heard of where they videotape themselves
excuse me and it was um very scary to see what they found out i mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against you know two or three houses through a two divorces children's names locations
what we really didn't have the same opportunity you know and i guess that's when i also get upset that if you're going to do it then i want to do it too
right right it's a matter and that's um exactly what it is i mean that that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion um if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to i mean if you hate to say that but that's the way it is
right i mean i give you and idea that i had um and i would say i would say the ones the
but i think basically i think they should leave things the way they are right now i mean i don't really have enough in terms of an argument
and that's exactly i mean i can remember instances that uh wasn't as uh you know bad i don't know how it would be today well i know what it looks like i've been back for a reunion
it does yeah um but it's but it's an experience i wouldn't change i mean my husband um grew up in um
majority uh southern you know so that um when he saw where i you know
saw my later teenage years he was just i hate to say aghast because that sounds so trite but he was
um-hum i know what you're saying yeah the that
um and my background's heritage and their background it would be you know the well i guess i would say the or heritage
i know what you're talking about yeah
uh you know what i've got to go because that's my cordless battery going
about all i can say is i guess about picking schools um i guess uh if you don't know what you're going to do liberal arts program is a good idea um
right but they no but who does i mean i think i think all i think the majority of people just don't know no he looked at criteria such as location size of school yeah
well i don't know how to put this either in this way and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this but i just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today i think the refinement that they get i don't mean specifically etiquette or culture but just what you're saying just a solid background
because i just don't think at that age i just don't think that young people know what they want to do
it was easy for him to rule out he knew what he didn't want that's exactly yeah now is your other i mean we're talking a lot about what you think but obviously you're experiencing it uh did your other son um
and and now they can't find them and they're finding bodies in ditches you know i mean you think think why they say it's because you're over crowded it's over crowded then you think how can every is everybody that stupid or is the world really that rotten
and i had you know i knew some people that said why are you glad you did you know this had nothing and i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but i actually i mean there should be more cases like that where they
yeah i mean and that's just maybe because of the little more that they said celebrated that uh he's not the only one you know you you see somebody's mini series and you hear about somebody's crime there was something on and this gets back to capital punishment
and had played the lead role and the man and and the at the end of you know how they have these mini dramas at the end they said this set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking oh
i don't know i think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime i think everyone would you and i think are probably honest and candid because we could do it on in this vehicle um but i think everybody if they were touched by it would say
because you wouldn't know what you're getting um
oh okay well then i can tell you that roles have changed i'm thirty eight and they've changed quite a bit um
the choices i mean you know you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that that's kind of um the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies it was sort of just to um go protest and uh
they have to do everything you know sort of i call kind of i call it a chewing syndrome they have to eat real fast they have they have to rapidity of speech they have to just go through everything
and you'll find that probably by the time you're twenty eight thirty if you haven't slowed down something will slow you down do you know what i'm saying um because it's just you find out that you're really not um smelling the roses and i know that sounds trite and all that
no you're extremely yeah it's it's just well it's like us we're getting ready to uh do if possible for an adoption and i have friends that say well why would you do that if you know you haven't been able to have children which we do know why would you do that now at this part point and um
um but what i was going to say about mothers is uh your mother probably just won't say it but i mean my mother and her sisters are always saying uh to my cousins and i my female cousins
right right i know no matter what you do about that yeah unless you're like a or something which i am not yeah i know it's um i don't know and then when you interview for a job or something sometimes people
um expect the benefits to take the place of a certain salary level you know they'll say maybe we'll pay you amount annually but then we you know ten percent to fifteen percent more is are your benefits and if you're like are you married
you know it's eighty twenty but they're then they're getting ready to change it again for um i don't know i just don't think companies um they want you to feel responsible and don't abuse the medical system and you know
but then you know like a lady in my office said she said her husband works for too and she said what about the people that are walking around and i hope uh i don't you don't sound like you're in this category but i mean for extremely obese people or something
the kind of people that can't sit in the airline airplane chair you know you know who's going to croak first the people that smoke or you know seems like an unnecessary penalty yeah i mean i'm not all for smoking at all but i just you know i don't know how they can do it
i mean i don't know um what other what other type of benefits do they have that i mean based companies companies they have to be a little bit different than the then
but i i don't know i think everywhere they just need to uh sit down and hire some uh people the grunts as i call them like myself to tell them yeah i mean
and doesn't have anything like that you know so i guess i i wish the companies like and a lot others were more progressive
um-hum and i mean i mean i don't know how you and your husband are too but i mean we have friends that laugh at us and we i clip coupons and i said hey i'll probably do this even if i'm a millionaire which i won't ever be but i mean it's like because you just can't i mean it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something
well the car insurance is due i mean it's yeah it's kind of i know i don't know what we're going to do about it yeah you want to rob a bank no i didn't say that i didn't say that on this line
um-hum and that doesn't doesn't make it any better it's just i guess something you have to keep telling yourself you know that um that's what i want that uh you know people are lucky to have jobs and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits
but benefits i don't know i guess i guess one thing i'd like to see too and i i don't know how is about this but i'd like to see um employees rank and file be able to contribute more to their um the execution of their job
is oh they're better but they're a little bit too um stiff collared in terms of you know what you want to do they're pretty much put the if that's where the widget goes stick it in the hole you know
um i'm trying to think of what else we like to eat the one thing i notice it's it's just um about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt i mean we find it prohibited just the cost anymore
yeah and i don't know how you feel about that but i think some of it's over priced
and i remember when we went we were married with another couple that was just dating and um i had never had sake it made all the raw fish taste great
i think it'll be worth it and somebody said to me in terms of this is food so i can say this but they said you have to bring the formula and i said what's that
they laughed and i said well you know
i'm thirty something and i and i said is that what makes them drool anyway you know i guess it are you is it a little bit constricted because a lot of restaurants don't take in terms of talking about restaurants i mean are a lot of restaurants
um boy but other than that i don't know we we do our share of pizza eating too
that's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way you know down the hallway
and the doctor said you didn't do anything there's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you that was night and night the radiologist called me at work and uh i was on crutches and he said i think you better call an orthopedist
yeah they do i mean i guess i'm glad you know that um nobody really noticed i guess you could say
do you like that what'd that voice say do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to
like that orthopedist said to me he said don't worry he says he said uh you're at thirty something but you're on the upper side he said that uh don't worry he says even if you weren't doing anything your body would start that would start to happen to you
yeah there some things i'd like to try but you know sometime when i ask i just feel like boy am i stupid or what
yeah i was going to say our mortgage is is between depending on you know it it drops um seems like in the last six months we um got lucky and we refinanced and it but it was like eight hundred and something but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty
that's exactly uh growing i grew up in western near and uh we used to call the basements actual cellars so it's funny to hear that word because i never hear it you know it's like the back porch used to be a stoop you know
but uh um the housing is just we like the older homes and i don't know if we're going to stay here or not depends you know i mean
we really would like to but we don't know if we're going to do it unless we stay here you know it
yeah it it's real tough i mean the economy any more i mean i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything you know it's um pardon me
getting to agree to things that i'm sure and i also think that once you get to be um you know certain when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older
so it's an investment but it's something that you know when you're first married or starting out you think if you really have something but you really it's just real nowadays with the way income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize
gee i needed that you know and then you get the remote control the stereo phonic whatever and all of those things
oh i'm in i was just saying where am i calling you from yeah well then i don't know if you like the or not or
and uh i'm trying to think what else i watch on television i like i like tennis so i mean i'm not i haven't played in years but um i just like to watch you know two two players really get go at it on television
yeah let's see what all's on television oh if you don't have a we just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it yeah cause you know if you like movies like we do
yeah really that's television i don't know in general on this project we're suppose to talk about that so i mean i'm that's okay don't i mean i i always digress
uh yeah actually i think it has i mean they finally like and some of those people they really have some funny characters on there
and they say well they're trying to deduce what he what he or she is so to see if it's a female they say well do you carry a purse and says no i carry a fanny pack
yeah i mean you really you can do without one but after awhile you'll start um you know i mean you just kind of all of sudden cause you're going well gee that you hear about something that somebody else talked about
is that on tape there you go yeah oh my what else is on i don't know what did they watch in college when you where in where did you go to school
it is um at i'm trying to think i went to high school in i'm trying to think what kids watch
oh i mean yeah and you talk about stress and pressure i tell you what it's uh
i don't know it what gets me is i can't believe that um
um i can definitely uh see on down the road you know when we do have kids and are getting to that age that's gonna be a definite concern
well and i think uh you touched on it you know you've got to start them at the home
yeah a lot a yeah well you take i mean everybody does
well this i mean i mean you look at look at the statistics i mean it's sad one in five can't read
well you know you know you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house
no i mean uh yeah they uh they do an absolutely necessary job i mean i i admire i have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that
um but uh i mean there there's a there's a sense of priorities here too you know we need to what's more important picking up the garbage or educating our kids
you know it's it's just it's it's ridiculous the way unions have gone i mean there was there was a time when unions were needed
but um i work in sort of a building that's that's not really it well it's on the campus of the facility but it's a little bit you know separated we lease the building and it's mainly it's a factory environment
yeah i mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing
i don't know if they do it yet
because when he was at course now it's been years now because it was before it was even before they had the the designated smoking type stuff you know at i forgot what i guess it was like eighty four
and uh a friend of mine said she that she grew this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had uh a pet cow named and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name said my cow lived seventeen years
but you really need to see that movie i i we we bought the movie and i don't i don't know how many times i've seen it and it came on the other night and i was watching it again and my husband heard me laughing and he said i can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie
oh yeah yeah well you know i don't i don't know all that much myself i just i just know when i hear it that i like it
but you know what you can do at a lot of these lakes and things if you could find a centrally located like uh say it's about the same distance for all of y'all to come they have these places where you can rent them
right because once it went to the the oldest people and then they knew who they wanted to invite then they sent their little things to us okay it was up to me
who i was going to you know whether i wanted my kids and you know my any of my family to come
but i think it finally sunk in you know because she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them say you know well i used a credit card
and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them any uh interest now it's and people say well you know i'm making money by using this credit card but they don't realize that if they
so it we decided that was it you know and i mean everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card we have we could have credit cards running out our ears
yes yes and then i'll i'll have just like uh department stores they'll call me up you know and i'll say look i don't want the credit card well we're just going to send it to you you know you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to they'll send me any credit card i tear it up
like on vacation they would let you use it maybe once a year you know i mean of course i guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but um
she got uh i can't remember what she called it it's some kind of maybe it's sure or something like that it's something it's some weird name of a credit card and she is charging out of her mind already and i'm going you just got off
well i had everything when i was at home but i i don't know why i didn't
well i'm going to tell you what i'd have
right and uh usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up and put some color into it you know and i'll lay those on top of my salad you know to make it look nice and things like that
i can't even think of what you i guess if it uh it looks like more like a cross between uh a crab and uh and a lobster because it's small like that and it's got the pinchers like a crab but
but you do have to have it you know you do have to have it hot when you cook it i mean your pan it does have to be really hot you know when you put it in but it's not like it's burned and it what it what blackens it is the seasoning
and uh usually if you can find somebody of course now when you go down there you know i mean they've got just there's no where you can miss
and they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked you know and so they figure why go out and vote you know they're going to do what they want to do they're corrupt anyway
i've heard so many people say well i'm not going on voting on that one you know i i'm going to go fishing today or it won't make any difference if if i don't vote and i think it does we vote every time
right and maybe maybe let them have some mock i mean uh you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start really young that's a real good idea
and that's the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party okay we're going to have a block party everybody's going to get together we're going to discuss the different issues and stuff and then we're going to go and vote you know we're going to go vote like
small the ballot is i mean if there's one thing if there's one issue because the way i feel is if i don't vote then i don't have any reason to gripe
and uh maybe if they like you said if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all
he needs your vote just like he needs everybody elses you know maybe if they were brought up that a way like you said it would
so there wasn't any way i was going to go in there and vote and it took me i mean it took such courage you wouldn't believe to go vote the first time because i was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because i didn't know how to work the machines
i didn't know how to work the machine you know and it really scared me really bad because i thought all these people are going to laugh at me because i don't know how to work this machine where if they'd if they'd had a class or something or just a short
i said asked him something about well did you who did you vote for for uh cheerleader and he said oh i didn't go vote he said uh there's no way i'm getting in that machine well then i realized it so when we went and voted the next time i asked
and she said well uh why you know he'll have to come back out i said because i want him to know how to use one of these and i said i won't turn any of the buttons down but i want to show him how to use it so that he'll be able to vote
yeah well i guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest
and so um but he said no he was going to plant in the earth you know like he always has because he's always had a garden out in the country
and i think he kind of misses it a little bit you know since we moved to the city but um
they look like orchids is what they look like but they look like different color ones like i have uh yellow ones and i have red ones and i have purple ones and then they have like you know the real velvety looking stuff inside
different kind of things and so i kept saying well i want to take a few of these and i want to take these and i want to take these
my husband finally said look are we going to take the grass can we leave the grass i said yes we may leave that and i had a tree
but the last day he said can't we leave the grass and i said yeah i think we will leave that
but um i brought um my kids when they were little they had given me uh some azaleas so i brought all my azalea bushes and you know i brought i brought as much as i could bring
they bought the place but um i knew that they would you know if i left like one bulb of each one of them by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them
i even tried making it look nicer you know i tied the yellow ribbon around it it was so ugly oh it did not help let me tell you i took it off and put it on my door i did not want to call attention
um like i think is what we have and it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country
all these little things like we had cucumbers coming up you know in the middle of our okra and i thought how did this get here i know i didn't put that seed there you know and it was weird but the birds had you know evidently just
i don't know because you know they gave away a lot of their drafts
so i don't know i hadn't heard you know whether they have a new one or not
huh-uh not yet but i mean i don't know whether they have one of the first you know choices of somebody that would be real good
the quarterback all of them every one that they played i think they played uh i can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks but all of them were bad i mean they were terrible they could not pitch you know they couldn't even take hand-offs it was terrible
but i tell you what if you get to watch some of these now i don't know how it will be this year you know but i mean these games go right down to the wire
and uh to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us
so we had to sit there you know and they cut the show off and showing started showing us another football game
cut us off right there the last few seconds the station finally you know how they'll put the little message down at the bottom started telling everybody that they were not the ones that had cut that off that it was the national you know
uh-huh yeah i do too i think it's going to in like in the future i think all women are going to work i mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby
let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you would you know
i just don't know where it would come from
if i'd of probably had three or four children i don't see how we could have made it you know without me working
right but i think i would have had to work if i'd of had that many i'd of had to work in order for my kids to you know even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work
but i think it's getting more and more like when you have one child now that's it you know then you go to work and you work because
well you know i can't imagine how i did because now i work all the time and um well i work all week and um i can't imagine how i stayed home you know i think to myself what did i do
right i mean they thought that it was terrible you know and then when i'd tell them you know well i'm just not ready for children yet oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now well you don't just get ready
if you don't want the kids then it's not the time to have it i don't care what anybody tells you and i think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way
you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids or even if you had two kids you would be paying
because you always think i mean i don't know maybe you don't but just like me
i always think well you know these things must be safe but that's just like i don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist
i mean hear about more people that have things like that you know and see what they think of them the different kinds because i've only ridden in the one that's it
yeah and then uh he talked about a van and i said well you know i don't know i don't know how the gas is on most of these
and another thing was that's the reason i said you know there was such a big difference you know in a little economy car but i said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along
expertise may be uh i think sometimes other things suffer and that i think it's hard to find a balance there
i well i hope to see employer based you know helping out you know child uh care centers at the place of employment and and things like that that will help out
what do you think do you think we're setting a trend here or
families and and raising children because children i think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground i think they uh they need security
so stringent as you know to make us feel uncomfortable
um it's all part of the savings account we just keep track of it on paper uh you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account we decide okay you know let's say it's a hundred dollars you know every month fifteen dollars is for car fund
it and it goes toward different things it's for you know for vacations like i said for you know emergencies like for car uh breaks down something like that uh and we also put money aside for our kids college
things cropped up you know so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget well the first time we did it we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be and then we kept track of everything for a month
you know how much we spent on food how much we spent on gasoline how much we spent on everything and from that built you know a cash budget so now i mean i have
i don't even remember what it is now four hundred dollars for the month let's say and um mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else and
well how do you make how do you you cook crawfish i in fact i just came back from the grocery store and being in we don't have too many you know people that that eat
yeah it's um it's in the other room i don't know if we have enough time for it it's real easy one of the unique things in this like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um
this is pretty unseasonal unseasonal but um at least we you know it it it feels good it gets uh everybody doesn't have cabin fever today it's nice to get out and about
yeah you really it seems to be influenced by a lot of different music a lot of times you'll hear songs that you know they're not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm
then you know then we thought well we can use it for you know some personal things but it for us it really took you know a business application to justify the expense of it
yeah and i think about it i guess for for kids like as they get older especially now
yeah any more i don't even know if they have if a college kid would have a typewriter
yeah i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people you know special interest groups can blow up
teaching these kids you know how really the basics is what it comes down to
well me too i uh i think we both agree there's some problems there but
that sounds fun i think maybe we'll try to do that
well i think i don't know if we've done five minutes but i'm sure that'll be
oh i know especially if you get what is it i think that that just about breaks the bank right there
in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say hey you know this person did a wonderful job give him a big bonus kind of thing a lot of times
i loaded the kids in the car and we went downtown and met her train for half an hour and brought her a little snack and an basket and i think it it made her trip a little bit nicer
oh well good good you have a little time think about that i guess i have uh when i was teaching school i saw many kids so many kids that were at loose ends
hum i may well i don't know around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for
we had visited relatives in not too long ago and i thought i had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up and
and if you look at history at all you see that you know uh we go from one side to the other on just about any subject that you one might care to bring up but
i do crochet and a lot of uh things like that and i have very little of my own stuff and and it it's kind of embarrassing people say let me see some of your work
i've seen some and there there they i suspect they're fairly simple because the one lady i've seen i know that does it i've never asked her any questions but she has three kids all under the age of like six
i've it's kind of funny i'd called this number and i just reading through a a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up i mean around you got
uh low cardiovascular fitness and also uh you know the cholesterol it gives you uh increased and decreases your yeah so
right so i think we find out what's happening in the city uh on a fairly frequent basis over a over a gin and tonic sort of thing uh and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of than than the paper would have anyway
if if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who murdered who or stole what from whom and that was the sort of thing that i would say is the best in and not news
well do you think we there's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies and
which i don't think is what it was meant to do
music i'm not a not a music um i'm not particularly schooled in it i know what i like to listen to as far as classical music
uh but in a in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude and i keep thinking gee i thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand but it doesn't for me
this one that you raised and i don't think i would have thought about that i think that's a good idea on your part i don't typically feel intruded on on the things oh in the sense of finding out information
uh the the other side of that might be uh if if someone there's someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense
i don't know if they suffer
yeah taxes would undoubtedly be occurring uh there i don't know i i don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation
first identify myself as middle aged and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that
or to put their child into a setting into a home setting where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and
uh who deliberately say no we'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever
i do not know i wonder where he gets it you know you must i think is bad because they uh show all sorts of violence on
i think our justice system needs to be stricter i mean because everyone they do it and then they get out in a couple of years it seems like
i mean i i tend to agree with you i think uh what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes um there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it
i guess mostly i bike on my own i've got a touring bike
uh or maybe just because you know there's there's a lot more flat lands you know out in the west so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation
you know i guess the last time i did it before that was college which was about ten years ago and uh yeah i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while um
yeah i mean i really think if the had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and uh
they didn't say what they just said they thought acid rain's contribution may be less than was previously suspected um but it may be other natural things at work
but um i don't know i mean what do you think we can uh i guess as individuals or as a group do about uh air pollution
big problem i mean i remember reading an article that said like it's the older polluters the the twelve and the fifteen year old cars you know contribute like ninety percent of the automobile pollution and the new cars it's hardly it's hardly anything
it you know it's it i mean they do generate a lot of soot but that at least you know that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly
you might be well i think we've used up as much time as we're supposed to anyway we're supposed to do five minutes and that was three minutes ago hey well thanks for the call yeah bye
so far this year year or was it during the last year somewhere during a years time i think it was they executed twenty five people in the nation meanwhile there were twenty five hundred people on death row
so i i and it's building up you know they're they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up
anyway well the question is you know do you think it it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done right
and and that way we can be sure you know we can find out the truth we can find out what really happened
that you know you never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not
so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer you know the technicians work the eight to five job and and know when they're going to be there
yeah i mean you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child
but i think in between we got a a group of kids a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because
yeah i'm i'm saying this as i'm trying to keep my nine month old from trashing something
okay uh could you tell me what you think contributes most to uh air pollution
oh they didn't say they didn't say what though they just said they thought it was
well i was gonna to say right you could put it in you could you could it could be installed like a catalytic converter i mean i guess you could take those off too but
you should uh pursue that i think or patent it you know
i know i uh the i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in uh and uh they had a waiting period and uh
i'd lose my gun but we wouldn't lose our pistol or our shotgun and uh we're wanting to get a couple more that no one knows about but i don't i don't uh
so it's not a new home it's it's seen some wear and tear
and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house so if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main in the street you know and oh it's it can be really bizarre and we never know where it's going to flood
yeah they came in and they had it one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it we had to call the insurance company i mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof roof was being repaired
oh i know that there's several people i've talked to that really have a problem with it and i'm former military so you get kind of used to to going through stuff like that you know you don't pay any attention to it i mean once you sign over your soul to might as you know you just kind of
you know my father was a fireman and i can just imagine if you know you know some guy being on drugs they go out there and and you know you've got somebody that's supposed to take care of you and they fall they fall out because of the drug issue you know
i know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field i don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing
also with uh women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what's it called job sharing like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or
i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful
uh-huh i guess i take it for granted kind of because i just it's always been that way but i know
oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of us was sick and i know she probably didn't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did
i think there's still some discrimination there where as you know men and work women work in the same job i think men get paid more but i think that's improving it's such a slow process it's frustrating but
i've seen a lot of people just say well you know he'll learn everything when he gets into
i guess what worries me about jogging is that i hear that it's very hard on your body and and that you know
yeah it is and it this has an you know my treadmill has an incline and you know you can get a really good workout on it
there was one guy i used to watch on i don't know if he's still on it anymore or not i don't i don't know if i get or not
uh i'm i never played an instrument in my life i've always wanted to i've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something
we went and saw uh i think it was uh that was good that had good music in it
i can't think of her name i got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it something
i never neither and i never have figured out how he won the entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row
yeah i remember mother and dad always turned on the
yeah and and it's i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences
especially you you know in the case of murder uh i know in my case i had my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty five and we caught the individuals got caught we uh
well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after him and they said well you know he they're he has no job he has nothing there's nothing that he has that that you could go after
oh yeah um you're not supposed to i mean you're not supposed to eat them
dead i mean well you eat them dead but right because if if they're dead for too long you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out and you're not supposed to eat those because they're the bad for you
um-hum maybe i that's about how much i can cook you know i'm i'm doing a lot more cooking now
and it has i don't know they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs and they are just absolutely delicious i don't know what she calls them and i don't i'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol but
oh yeah i have to impress the boss and clients because um i'm in i'm in public relations in school so i'm going to have you know my whole job's going to be based on my clients and stuff like that so
right now i am taking a class on and all the little bitty things that i didn't even know i mean i thought for sure i'd been raised properly but i'd been doing a lot of things wrong i didn't know about
um i don't know it it just seems like there was always something to do children are so full of energy
things like that but i feel like i don't know when i have children i want to be able to spend a lot of time with them
and i don't it would i think it was very beneficial to us i mean like in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books and we went skating a lot and
uh you know that's a good way to approach it i've never thought about um i do plan my clothes a week in advance actually i plan them a month in advance i usually do a month at a time so i don't repeat an outfit
he didn't you know he's not really into all that he would wear it if he had to for his job and all but you know if he had the preference i mean his his preference is um blue jeans and a so
but i think that's great about and also uh to get off the clothing the smokers you know how they have the the different designated areas for smokers and stuff i think that's great
yeah i haven't decided whether you're whether i wanna play yet or not i just bought myself a solo flex machine i don't know if you've seen those advertised on
okay which uh shows do you watch on
okay well um let's see i i think uh there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard and
that you know their votes votes not going to make that much difference
and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you know what you believe in and that person
yeah that's that's true i think in uh the governor election i think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time
because you know that's what the media says well the majority believes this way so
is this open and shut you know like you were saying or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened you know a jury like that
right that's that's a good idea i in the it says uh if you have something against somebody to go to them first
and you know we i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly
okay let's see i think uh i guess since i call i'm supposed to start i think that's the way everybody has done it so far
i don't know i do i can think of all the uh
yeah that's that's what he said here he's gotten us into a linear flow that we've never been in before
well i don't know i've i've had mixed emotions i guess when i listen to uh the radio and and watch about the different uh things that are happening i uh i'm against it but on the same token um i went out and purchased a gun just because i
and i thought that was really good and i think it they uh takes two weeks for that system to process um your request for uh
because if if you're gonna go buy something um of of that nature i think you've you're gonna have some idea as to what you're gonna do with it you're not gonna react that quickly in other words you know you have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day
yeah i do too uh because it doesn't make any difference uh uh whether it's a pistol or a shotgun i suppose they both do the same kind of job
uh yeah i suppose i'd never got shot with either one but i don't know um i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun
the um the rifle that i've got is not registered and um i don't know why i never registered it but the uh
um control i i don't believe in um should i shouldn't probably say control i mean regulation control is something that i wouldn't want the federal government to have but um but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability
uh she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it well after you had an animal for a couple of weeks it's uh you become attached you become attached to it
and and uh she wasn't able to jump she you know lost all her activity and uh she stayed there for one day and the doctor called me up and said uh she had a low white cell count and that
to me and said it's gonna cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive what do you wanna do i probably would've had second thoughts but what they well what they do is is they say well it's gonna cost
you know you really you you don't know what it's gonna cost until it's all over
and she had the cat there for two days and then the cat died so the doctor had called her up and said uh your cat died and you owe me this bill
yeah well even the you know they they claimed they did the best that they could and then the cat uh died so
uh you know it it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the when they
who's been to trial and has been in and out of jail you know basically a a three time loser for the twelfth time you know and he goes out and kills somebody he's not going to be reformed he's not going to get any better you know it's it's not going a
it does it really does you know she and they have to go back uh occasionally you know she has to write letters to the parole board and you know lawyers and
just just ever so often she mentions well she's got to do something else you know write another letter or do something it's just
oh that oh man i couldn't be a cop for that for that very reason you know because they do the the criminal gets right back out and you know the cop's just got to go back and
i know i guess they think that people don't watch but i mean if you watch it like five minutes then it repeats the same thing over and over and over
to their view of the world which i suppose just about everyone does but these guys had a a uh national soap box to stand on and and express this view
i i didn't have that experience i i don't have cable so i i'm pretty much limited to which i thought i thought they did a very good job
yeah he's gonna be going to kindergarten so so you know we're we're thinking about that what that what that gonna be like are they gonna be taught nothing are they gonna be taught something we're gonna we're gonna be involved in our child's education we're gonna be teaching him what we can at home of course
the best way but i think what's what's gonna have to happen is there's gonna have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids that's the only way they're gonna fund it because they start raising taxes for property and people are gonna throw a fit
i think that if uh young people had service the country might give them more ambition because it you know they they learn that serving other people is a is a good thing
oh gosh you go to the mall and you see you know fourteen year old kids flaunting money because their parents give them money to go down and play video games all night you know for what give me the money and i'll i'll teach you something good
when uh when i come time to get out of school i thought boy i'd like to teach but you know for for what you know i don't wanna live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life
and they told the strikers there look we need you to come back and get this stuff done or else we're gonna be out of business and they wouldn't come back so they went bankrupt and and they all lost their jobs
but you know they kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that and and they don't follow it at all you know there're very few scouts go on and become and and i don't know what the high rank is for the gals but
well it's been really good we talked about this for a few minutes and uh hopefully we'll have another good topic maybe another call someday but i i don't really have too much more to say on this topic i guess
we i guess we both agree that it's a good thing that they should do sometime well you take care and and enjoy the day thank you ma'am bye-bye
yeah is the only place i've ever been where i've seen the car sweat i mean yeah that's really bad
i tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate uh uh it doesn't doesn't some people say uh they they like to watch the changing of the seasons but
uh i i'd rather you know like southern you know have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time
