it's it's really neat i don't think uh hardly anybody lives there because it's just kind of like you know tourists
and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they or just real talented i should say lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching uh others have there's one gal that's in the uh
oh that's why i asked you i guess it you know it does go in cycles and not everyone got theirs right away
and you just have to set the time and say okay this is gonna be it
yeah well that's they say it it all it takes is about five ten minutes a day
well we did too and and i remember the one daughter saying we had a a a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree
it that you miss sitting home in your parlor you know uh with a with a a six pack of beer and some uh potato chips you know you you miss that and and any professional sport i think you miss that
i i know a lot i think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort
so i don't know i i guess we're kind of in the same boat we haven't had to look very carefully for child care
and the in a sense become unteachable they think they know all there is to know in their area set path and you know come in and put my time in from nine to five and
uh because i have a an economy car right now which is okay but uh i think i i'd like to move on to something a little better
so i guess you'd have to say if i was looking i would definitely be looking for a foreign car
well i really don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the case i mean i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
too many i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're uh you know worthy of working for us i really don't see that that's a very very valid uh
well i think i think what you i think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
there's too many cases where it can you know there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing i don't think there's any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs so we don't want him here
but uh i mean i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that it's such a a big deal i mean if your employer's not going to trust you or you know it i just i think it's a whole trust issue i just can't see it
you know i guess the cars had a bad reputation but i haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones i've had
and i just think it's really awful and i i'm with you on that you don't hear too many people say this but i think it's a very long day
so what does that tell you the it tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time
and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends and i called there to see if they had it and the lady was very nice and i said my goodness i said you've been very nice what's your name
and she told me and i said well i really appreciate it i said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store and it turned out she was the assistant manager
so i don't know and i think it could be used to hassle somebody if someone was out to get you
yeah i think you do you feel very good after you exercise i think it's worth making the time for yourself you owe it to yourself and i think you do accomplish more after that
and it's just uh i think it's well worth it i just demand that time for myself now i've learned to do that and it you know and it i think it just benefits you all around
i mean no you probably know i don't know nobody talks about it so i don't think we do
i don't know and then i got some nice uh mums at that i put in the pots out there and i thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather
so i don't think any of it comes back but i don't know maybe sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to
and i i just don't know what i would do if i had to do that i know the hospital that i work in is big hospital and they provide child care and of course they charge for it but at least all the nurses can leave their children and
i guess uh some child care each one of them and now they're in school so it's all over but uh
i you know i think those things get
but i think you know you you have to look through a place and you have to get a feel for um
i guess uh i think they've lost their compass and uh
yeah the immediacy just isn't there and um uh i also think that one one of the problems and actually i don't think this i think this is a cultural problem
and um i'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is and i'm really sad to say this i never thought i would have but i really think that uh the educational establishment has become part of the problem
so you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to uh admit or not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
is the government against the individual you need some kind yeah they need the protection of ordinary citizens i think that's really the only thing i guess where i would like to see the system system change is uh
if you're gonna use it for a lifetime i suppose it's worth it because um imagine if i go and sharpen them myself uh it won't last
those are two things that i think are going on although they i i don't think the politicians would tell you that
yeah i've heard the i've heard the construction's pretty good on and
no i it wasn't that big a deal uh when i when i think of crime i think of stuff that that affects affects other people like people getting you know killed or raped i think rape is one of the worst crimes
yeah if if that uh you know the sooner a a a year's plenty of time you know for something to come out i guess then you know there's been guys in jail for six years and the other guy admits that he did it and they
but i think nursing homes can be good just depends on what kind they are you know an you need to check them out
the more now i live in downtown and i uh you know i've seen uh i've seen cases on in the news and all where where you know uh a a
i see yeah i uh i was gonna say because i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for it says paper on it you know and uh if
uh i've heard uh you know uh in residential situations i live in a dorm and i've heard in residential situations uh like in
the only responsibility of the of the patron is to separate them and then the the uh i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them and it doesn't cost the patron anything doesn't really cost the uh department
i guess i guess by what you said you're you you don't feel you're uh privacy has been invaded invaded anytime recently
uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to you to tell them you know that you're not interested or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep asking you you know and and
yeah what do you think about um you know something that kind of concerns me is uh you you know you and i are tested for for whatever work we happen to do do you think there should be drug testing for political officials
i found when when i get when i get with my uh old college buddy we we usually rent uh good gladiator movie or two
and i really don't uh agree with that i don't think anyone who would commit a uh a crime that would get them the death penalty
i think uh if i personally had to put one of my parents in a nursing home they would have to be pretty bad off
i think there was a couple that were schizophrenic and i remember one time watching one of the uh schizophrenic patients actually go out on i don't know what they call it a binge or whatever you want to say it but
and yeah yeah and you have more competition and i think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community
uh relief for having children i mean there is none i mean i think i paid just as much as when i didn't have her
well i don't think people think they can make a difference and when you've got candidates as you do it's candidates that have money and it's backed by big business
this government itself isn't working just like the communist government of uh the old uh and maybe that's gonna happen to where they'll say hey we're fed up
unless there's a big issue going on like when we were at war then i think everybody was glued to the to find out what was going on
uh appropriate for a government to suggest that and say you know you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen or you know in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do
and teaching him that there is a whole community that is is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever and that's i think they have done that and
um you you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever i would say the crimes would probably be you know if you went in for a certain crime there might be somebody that has has done a crime even worse than what you have so you're dealing with people
and i think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because
well that's it you know and and i've kind of looked around uh at that uh too because uh salary wise i don't think i'm making as much with a big corporation because i think when you look at big corps
it it sure does and i think it it is reflecting like you said i think society as a whole
